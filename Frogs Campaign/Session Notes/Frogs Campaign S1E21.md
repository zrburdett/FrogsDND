### Session Summary


### Log
_**PREVIOUSLY**_ [[Glacialmaw]] had read a book in Giant - it is a notebook/ledger from a Builder, detailing the construction of the buildings in [[Macknus]], the greatest Giant city in the [[Wishbones]]. Whole bunch of information, a bunch of notes written in the margins. Complaints of bureaucracy. There's a new work in progress that he's been excited about.

_**TODAY**_ It's getting cold at this altitude as we begin our hike down the mountain. We hike a couple hours and eventually come across the shrine we had previously seen - the candle that was there has gone out/melted down to bare. At the shrine, the road diverges and leads towards [[Logor]], where we are headed. Snowfall gets heavier and it gets harder and harder to see. The path isn't exactly marked, but it's clear where the path goes, based on the shape of the mountain. The path is getting steeper and not really wrapping the mountain as much as before. The snow is getting harder and slicker. [[Draxus]] launches an [[Eldritch Blast]] into the wall nearby. [[Draxus]] starts a bit of an avalanche of ice on the path below us. [[Draxus]] continues blasting to set loose some ice so it doesn't hit us? We consider riding the boat into oblivion?? We all get in the boat... [[Draxus]] launches an eldritch blast behind us to start an avalanche and get this boat moving... Big chunk of ice breaks off and begins following the boat. It's a bit like a bobsled that we are traveling down on the boat. We start gaining so much speed that we are going over the corners instead of around.

_**UNEASINESS**_ (( 3 natural ones on perception... )) There's a cliff ahead... _"How fast do boats fall?"_ - [[Glacialmaw]] The boat leaves the ground. [[Draxus]] apparates with [[Virahck]] to the top of the cliff. [[Kothvush]] tries to fly and grabs [[Palu]], but isn't strong enough and drops her. The boat hits the ground in an explosion of splinters. [[Glacialmaw]] hits himself with his handaxe and makes a [[Flumph|flumph]] appear. The wood contracts together, shrinks, and then poofs out of existence. [[Glacialmaw]] makes light of the situation and [[Ebu Tart]] screams back, while [[Kothvush]] rips off a fabric patch and hurls it at [[Glacialmaw]]. In the air, it transforms into a [[Potion of Healing]] and splatters on the ground at [[Glacialmaw]]'s feet.

_**COMBAT**_ [[Kothvush]] gets hit in the back during his watch by an invisible something... We keep getting hit by something we cant see. We attack the ground incessantly. [[Kothvush]] screams at the moon _"What do you want from me, [[Selune]]?! Is this about [[Uthvish]] again?"_ before it shines a bit brighter, then it dims back to normal. [[Kothvush]] gets hit again and goes unconscious. [[Palu]] disturbs the snow with [[Thaumaturgy]] and a puff of snow coagulates between [[Palu]] and [[Kothvush]]. We see a shape erupt in flames as [[Palu]] casts [[Hellish Rebuke]]. It finally appears and then evaporates... It looked like a big cloud of blue... I realize it was an elemental. It was a conjured elemental - an [[Invisible Stalker]]. The conjuror is not within 50 feet...
