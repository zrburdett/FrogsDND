### Session Summary
After setting up camp along the riverbank filled with tents, firepits, and thousands of festival-goers, the party lays down to rest with [[Draxus]] as first watch. During the night, he catches the glimpse of a little boy staring at him, who darts off when their eyes meet. Draxus becomes sketched out and follows the boy across the Slumptown Bridge and into the [[Auyam Alley]] neighborhood. When he reaches the alley behind the [[Prying Pumpkin]], Draxus is confronted by a group of guards who tell him to leave the boy alone. He eventually makes his way back to the campsite and hands over the watch so he can rest.

The next morning, we make our way to the Public Trading Post, but are interrupted during our walk and are then told about the pickpocket challenge going on that day as a part of the festival activities. Essentially, you are given a handkerchief and are given a prize if you can swipe the most handkerchiefs by the end of the day, or can hold onto yours for the duration of the challenge. We are all given a handkerchief.

We arrive at the Public Trading Post and look around at the stalls for a while. We're told that you can rent one out to sell your own items at a nominal price of 1 gold, and anyone is more than able to place a bid on any items for sale - bartering is an option as well. We're also told that there is a large mine in [[Opul]] on the island of [[Lyniys]].

[[Virahck]] attempts to steal someone's handkerchief but actually just ends up grabbing some ass in the process. [[Kothvush]] gets his handkerchief stolen briefly but takes it back. Unfortunately, he ends up losing it later.

[[Draxus]] returns to [[Auyam Alley]] and tries to take a little peek into the [[Prying Pumpkin]]'s back door, but makes too much of a fuss and ends up getting roughed up and almost forced to take off the entirety of his clothing, so he blasts his way out and leave the place, presumably, in shambles.

[[Glacialmaw]], [[Palu]], and [[Virahck]] head over to the blacksmith and inquire about getting some upgraded armor but have to sell a gem in order to have enough gold to purchase, so they make their way to [[Silverweavers]], where they sell a gorgeous sapphire directly to the owner for 5,050 gold. [[Palu]] eyes a an octahedron made of Tanzanite mounted above the fireplace, but with the security around and the amount of influence the people who own it have, she decides not to swipe it.

### Log
The Mayor is up for reelection at the end of the festival.

We found a rather nice spot along the riverbank to sleep over the night. Around us, there are tents, firepits, hundreds of thousands of people, both sides of the riverbank are pretty packed with people.

There is a little boy staring at [[Draxus]] in the middle of the night during his watch. As they catch each other's eyes, the boy darts away in the crowd, with Draxus following close behind. They cross over Slumptown Bridge and head into the alleyway of the [[Prying Pumpkin]]. When Draxus turns the corner, he sees the boy surrounded by about 7 adults. The boy slips behind him while the adults confront Draxus about following the boy. They are the guards of [[Auyam Alley]], which is the neighborhood they're in. Draxus leaves after a short conversation without further incident.

We wake up bright and early in the morning, ready for a new day, and head out towards the Public Trading Post. A man approaches and invites us to participate in the pickpocket challenge. You will be given a handkerchief and you will win a prize if you still have a handkerchief at the end of the day or if you have the most at the end of the day. We all get a handkerchief.

[[The Dugout]] Neighborhood
The buildings are made of cut, light-gray stone, some single story wooden houses, some shared housing, some are nicer and bigger buildings.

We arrive at the Public Trading Post. Each booth is run by a member of the community and bids can be placed on anything listed as available. You may also rent a booth, it's only 1 gold per day for a rental. We also accept bartering at the discretion of the property owner. There's a large mine up north in [[Opul]] on the island of [[Lyniys]].

[[Virahck]] attempts to grab a handkerchief but accidentally grabs someone's ass. [[Kothvush]] briefly gets his handkerchief stolen, but soon steals it back.

[[Draxus]] splits from the group and heads back to [[Auyam Alley]]. He sees somebody in the alley and attempts to stealthily peep inside the [[Prying Pumpkin]]'s back door. It's a storage room with some of the guards sitting at a table playing cards. He steps inside and plays it off like he's lost and looking for handkerchiefs. One of them recognizes [[Draxus]] and tells him to leave and to avoid coming into the alleyway again. [[Draxus]] dives across the table and makes a mess of things attempting to grab a handkerchief. Three guards pick him up and demand that [[Draxus]] give them all of his clothes. One of them starts taking Draxus' pants off, but Draxus thunder steps away from them, causing a massive amount of damage, but he luckily makes it away.

[[Kothvush]] loses his handkerchief.

[[Glacialmaw]], [[Virahck]], and [[Palu]] head to [[Silverweavers]], a building made of shimmering marble with an orange glow to it. Two guards ask to pat them down before entering. Any weapons are left in a lockbox at the front. Inside the jewelry store, there are 6 more guards overseeing the patrons of the shop.

On the mantle in the back of the jewelry store where appraisals happen, is an octahedron made of Tanzanite. It is mounted on a stand and is about a softball sized gem. They offer 4,800 gold for our sapphire. [[Palu]] counters with 5,250. An old gnome woman returns with the appraiser and picks up the gem, saying "What did you want for it? Ummm, I could do 5,050."

The octahedron is a family heirloom and is not for sale. The attendant returns and pays [[Palu]].
