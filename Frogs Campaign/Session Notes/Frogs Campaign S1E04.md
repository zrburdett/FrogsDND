### Log
_**MAP**_ [[Azurak]] tries to find a place on the map that looks like where we are.

**GRAVE** There's a big hole at this grave. [[Azurak]] casts [[Detect Magic]] - there's a tiny glowing wooden box (6"x6"x12") [[Glacialmaw]] climbs down and grabs the box, opening it. _**BOX**_ The box grows drastically in size and unfolds into a boat. Can hold 4 medium creatures or 15 creatures. [[Derrick Ifburge|Derrick]] wrote the commands: - **Send** - small 4 creature boat - **Nudes** - large 15 creature boat - **Please** - close box We head west of the house.

**WESTERN PATH** As we continue down the path, we see the same old same old. _**SHORT REST**_ We see some buildings at the end of the path. They're better maintained but still kinda fucked up.

**BUILDING ONE** Dilapidated building, but smoke is coming out. The door is shut and the blinds are drawn. [[Glacialmaw]] chucks a rock at the door - it makes a loud noise or two. Nothing seems to be happening. [[Glacialmaw]] kicks the door down.

 **INSIDE BUILDING ONE** It's a damn mess. Burning paper in the fireplace but it seems to be almost out - couple hours old. [[Azurak]] sees a hidden lever - opening a secret drawer with 12 silver and 3 copper pieces.

 **BUILDING TWO** Pretty shitty too. Knocked over table and chairs. **INSIDE BUILDING TWO** Nobody appears to be here either. [[Mo]] eats some leftover stew and (moldy?) cheese from the ground, eats a carrot slice. There's a wand on one of the higher up shelves - [[Wand of Burning Hands]]. [[Palu]] takes the wand. [[Glacialmaw]] also picks up a necklace with a bunch of teeth.

**BUILDING THREE** Smaller, less stuff in here, mostly empty.

**BUILDING FOUR** Strangely tidy - perfectly made bed, tables neat, fire still glowing, half eaten meal still on the table. The bed appears a little big. Some goblin clothes in the dresser but a beautiful purple cloak robe too - bunch of patches on the robe with a ton of images. [[Kothvush]] takes the [[Robe of Useful Items]] and puts it on. [[Glacialmaw]] messes up the bed. Virahck hits the bed with his morningstar - fucks it up real good.

_**[[Robe of Useful Items|ROBE OF USEFUL ITEMS]]**_ Dagger, Bullseye Lantern, steel mirror, 10ft pole, hempen rope, sack, iron door, 4 healing potions, a pit, 2 mastiffs, window, portable ram

**BUILDING FIVE** [[Virahck]] enters. There's a table with a map carved on the top. It's of the prison. There are several more floors but no obvious staircases. There's a jar with severed pickled toes (four, all different toes from different feet), a burlap bag filled with sand - with 2 fish heads inside. Also a coin purse with 8 silver, 12 copper. [[Glacialmaw]] takes the toe jar and drops Herbert's finger into the jar.

**BUILDING SIX** [[Palu]] enters and sees a huge number of fish heads - estimated 45 heads. There's a rabid squirrel in a cage on the dresser. [[Kothvush]] finds an herb to apply to the squirrel and it seems to relax a bit. Azurak tames the squirrel with bagpipes. We name the squirrel _**[[Sir Schwaggus]].**_

**BUILDING SEVEN** A lil bigger than the others, large front window, curtains draw, door closed. Ain't shit in here. Actually there's a dead baby goblin, crushed by [[Virahck]]'s [[Morningstar]]. As we pull up more floor boards, we uncover more baby goblins - there are 11 still alive between the ages of 1 and 8. We tie them all up in a line and start down the path - [[Glacialmaw]] is leading them.

**WESTERN PATH** We lead the line of 11 goblin child slaves down the path. We are still in the thick of the woods, though. As we round the next corner, the 3 humans we are walking with sneak attack us.

_**COMBAT**_ [[Glacialmaw]] drops the leash and the children run away. _**COMBAT OVER**_

**A CLEARING** We continue down the path and come to a clearing.

**SMALL BUILDING** Nobody inside. There is a pair of oars, a bit of dry grain bar - [[Azurak]] eats, does [[Azurak]] drink the piss bottle? - no

**DOCKS** We walk over to the docks and [[Glacialmaw]] calls out _**NUDES!**_ to expand the boat to 15 creature size.
