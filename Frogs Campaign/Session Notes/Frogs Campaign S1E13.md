**THE GREATFUL SHED**
[[The Grateful Shed]]
30ish gold per night for the performances, band gets a small percentage We're considering doing one last show for [[Uncle Glom's Band]], except it's under the name [[Drawn and Quartered]] - they reject the name. [[Draxus]] does an incredible job creating flyers for the show tonight. [[Draxus]] cuts a tree down so [[Kothvush]] can make a community board to put the flyer on - the boards are surprisingly square. [[Glacialmaw]] mildly vandalizes the poster on the community board with the rejected band name. [[Virahck]] gives [[Jurte]] a bit of water to keep them alive for a little bit longer.

_**THE PERFORMANCE**_ It's more populated that the previous night. There are some empty chairs but there are like 2 or 3 dozen people there. The dancing lights from [[Draxus]] keeps people interested for the first song but it goes downhill from there - eventually inciting a riot where people start to destroy [[The Grateful Shed]]. Once [[Glacialmaw]] steps off the stage, people start to cheer and have a better time. The show ends and everybody leaves - the place is traaaashed... I need to use your payment to repair the shed... We get into an argument with [[Johnny Sack]] about payment. [[Glacialmaw]] destroys one of the only standing tables left in response. We get kicked out. We start to get bit by some mosquitos...

_**TO THE NORTH**_ Under the light of the moon, we head north towards [[Eroglyf]]. In the morning, the sun starts to rise and we must decide if to stop or to continue. We open up the big boat and head down into the cabin of the boat. We travel for several days before coming across...

**CHUNKY ROCK** Almost bone spikes coming out of the ground in front of a cave. It's a pretty shallow cave but there's something on the ground in the cave... As [[Draxus]] gets closer, he recognizes a **[[giant scorpion]]**.

_**COMBAT**_

**CAVE ENTRANCE** We take a nice _**long rest**_ during the day. [[Palu]] severs the scorpion's tail. The four spikes in the ground don't look natural but [[Kothvush]] hasn't got a clue what they are. We start to detect magic... The spikes glow... and so does something in the back of the cave. Each of us touching the spikes feel it shift a bit down. We push the spikes into the sand and hear a noise from out of the cave. There's an opening in the wall of the cave!

**_REAL_ CAVE** There's a fork in the road up ahead.

**BIG HOLE** 6 to 8 seconds for the torch to drop 30 feet across the hole

**SECOND BIG HOLE** There's motion at the bottom... Flapping of wings! A beast flies up from the bottom - a green dragon [[wyrmling]]. [[Virahck]] is lagging behind... He tries to cast a spell to restrain the beast in vines, as he is bit by the dragon.

**CAVE ENTRANCE** We're done here, don't want to deal with the dragon. There are some concerns that another party is following us - perhaps changelings considering all the footprints are the same sizes of our feet. _**MOVING ON**_

**SMALL RIVER** We come across a small river, which is going north, and eventually come across a bridge. It's about 30 feet down to the water from the bridge. On the other side of the bridge is a _**tiger!**_

_**COMBAT**_ [[Draxus]] sets the bridge on fire and the tiger begins to retreat. Virahck tries to put out the flames but gets attacked by the tiger.

_**BRIDGE COLLAPSE**_ We kill the tiger and cross the bridge before it collapses. We start to see something in the distance...

_**[[DRAXUS]]' DREAM** - unshared_ He sees a great beast beneath the sea, a western wind blows, fresh peach - yucky sand actually. Empty hands bloody pyramid...
