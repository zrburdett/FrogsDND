### Session Summary


### Log
**A City in the Distance** Large Bustling Metropolis Canals are being dug in the distance In the distance we can see 5 pyramids. There's one pyramid that has a red hue rather than the normal brownish. [[Draxus]] seems to believe that the red pyramid was covered in blood in his dream. We decide to move forward to the gates.

**EROGLYF**
[[Eroglyf]]
There's a wide variety of people around, hard to think of a race that isn't there. None seem to be [[Drow]], nor Trolls... [[Draxus]] remembers that the center of power is in the pyramids - a counsel of wealthy people who run the city, and he knows where they meet and work. [[Draxus]] confronts a guard with a story about the legendary [[Drow]] adventurer that he is! The guard seems on edge but open to the idea... [[Glacialmaw]] pretends to be [[Draxus]]' fan and it convinces the guard that he's famous... and asks for an autograph as well. The important people stay at _**[[Glowingz]]**_. We also see _**[[Blankets]]**_ the blacksmith, a bar the _**[[Unlucky Tick]]**_, a couple inns, and a pet store called _**[[Darcy's Pets]]**_.

**DARCY'S PETS**
[[Darcy's Pets]]
There are a loooot of rats. [[Palu]] really wants a bird to sit on his shoulder and we also inquire about purchasing a bag of rats. [[Glacialmaw]] starts singing to the rats and they actually really like it! The lady offers the bag for 3 silver and 5 copper.

_**MIGUEL SMELL**_ _Sniff sniff_ Oh dang, it looks like it's Miguel's shop! [[Tiguel]] is this guy's name, he is [[Miguel]]'s cousin. His two best sellers are the [[Unlucky Rabbit's Foot]] (3 silver) and an [[Orb of Illusion]]. They have a celebration every year in the [[Andees]] for a family gathering. It takes about a month of travel to get there from here. You can reattach limbs with the [[Unlucky Rabbit's Foot]]! If it doesn't work, then you can get your money back. Virahck purchases 10 [[Unlucky Rabbit's Foot|unlucky rabbit's feet]].

_**GLOWINGZ**_
[[Glowingz]]
There's a prominent shoe rack and the walls are made of finely carved wood and everyone is clean and neat. There's a desk with an attendant in the back. They have rooms available and suites, too. Suite has 6 beds and a full kitchen - 12 gold per night. ^Food is included. [[Virahck]] and [[Glacialmaw]] arrive but [[Virahck]] trips and two rats get free. ~~Virahck whispers to the rats before letting them free on the first floor of Glowingz.~~ He decides against this because then he wouldn't have any more rats. Couple of us try to fall asleep on the road outside of [[Glowingz]] but soon get kicked out by the guards.

_**GLUMIEZ**_
[[Glumiez]]
It's a much cheaper inn, pretty dilapidated but still not too shabby. [[Draxus]] notices that there's a person that a bunch of people walk to, talk to, then leave without patronizing the inn. The pyramids are the [[Paelor Sabatons]] the twin pyramids. [[Leisure Palace]] is a place of rest and socializing, most people aren't allowed in... For the rich and powerful. [[Summit Athenaeum]], library with entry for good cause - greatest library in the northern sea. [[Red Pyramid]] that collapsed years ago and was abandoned. 17 [[Counsel of Masters]] that oversee the country of [[Tapu Ero]]. We sleep through the day and wake up at night, because of [[Draxus]]' light concerns.

_**We chat with the guy.**_ [[Draxus]] starts talking with the man and asks about clothing to cover his skin. The man has met a [[Drow]] before, a long time ago. There's a tailor (named [[Taylor the Tailor|Taylor]]) in the upper city that can fashion something. He is affiliated with a certain organization... That's located in the upper city but we source contractors from down here. The guild is always looking for workers. You group of folks look above the pay grade down here... You should see the guild. There's a sign of a hooded man, you shouldn't miss it. Name's **Joseph**.

**Hooded Man Door** [[Glacialmaw]] is continually knocking at this door in the upper city.

**GLUMIEZ**
[[Glumiez]]
Virahck gets his ears pierced with a dirty, bloody needle !

**Hooded Man Door** The building is very sturdy and kept structurally sound and pristine as opposed to the nearby area. It's convenient that [[Glacialmaw]] is here without knowing that we were going to come here. We come in and tell them Joseph sent us. "Just don't unsheathe any weapons while you're in here. And uh... don't show anyone your ethereal axe..." "Do not bring your rats in here. One of you should stay outside with the rats. [[Virahck]] stays outside and looks for rat food."

_**INSIDE**_ Ornate hall with patterned carpets, almost nicer than the inside of [[Glowingz]]. Desk with attendant directing people around. It's not very populated but it is late in the evening. Hotel lobby vibes. While [[Palu]] conducts a vibe check, the vibe actually gets worse... Desk attendant's name is [[Toeseph]]. We ask about what [[Guild]] is all about. "Everything [[Guild]] does is legal." [[Draxus]] asks if there's any work available and hears that there's lots of work available. We must be a rather experienced party if [[Joseph]] sent you here. "There's this book that we had in our personal libraries. [[All the Many Histories of Tapu Ero]]. We thought we could find some information from it, but only had it a day before it disappeared. Nobody got a chance to read it. If I had to guess, it was our rival in [[Eroglyf]] that may have it. The cover had a picture of [[Tapu Ero]] and the pyramids on it. We absolutely want it back. [[Guild]] would compensate the party. We might even dispatch one of ours to accompany you. _quietly_ [[Palu]] tells us that he has the book. It's worth a pretty penny, couple hundred gold. Maybe try to up the price by going to another guild... We talk about accepting the quest and asking around to find it's true value. _regularly_ We're gonna go try and find this book, [[Toeseph]].

**[[Taylor the Tailor]]** We wonder if she is dead.

**Red Pyramid**
[[Red Pyramid]]
The red pyramid is kinda further away from the other ones. As we get closer, there aren't as many people, buildings, etc. By the time we get there, there isn't much of anything around. There's an entrance on the side with a pair of giant doors. The doors don't budge - and appear to be locked. There are carvings in the door, just patterns though. [[Draxus]] eldritch blasts the door, but there isn't much damage. [[Palu]] casts [[Detect Magic]] and the door lock glows. Though most of the carvings are patterns, there are also people with tusks - orcs. [[Draxus]] asks for one rat and kills the rat as if to be a sacrifice to the [[Demogorgon]]. The blood sprays in the direction of [[Palu]] and [[Draxus]] feels an urge to move in his direction. [[Draxus]] thinks the [[Demogorgon]] thinks Palu has some knowledge. _[[Draxus]] swings his axe at [[Palu]]!_ [[Draxus]] slits his own wrist and bleeds on himself and attempts to bleed on Virahck, who then restrains [[Draxus]]. On the way down, [[Draxus]] catches a glimpse of [[Palu]]'s bag.

_**[[All the Many Histories of Tapu Ero]]**_ Over the last 300 years. The island was exclusively inhabited by orcs until 250 yrs ago. The orcs were eventually pushed off the island. [[Eroglyf]] was the last city of orcs to fall, the emperor was extremely popular but people eventually lost faith and abandoned him. The [[Wishbones|Wishbone islands]] had a similar experience between orcs and giants. It used to be called [[Erog]]. For the last 250 years the counsel has run the city and the country from the pyramids. The pyramids were built by the orcs but it was taken over by the invading people.

**THE SUMMIT AETHENIUM** (library)
[[Summit Athenaeum]]
We'd like to go to the library. "What business do you have here?" We are scholars, of course. "Come in!" [[Draxus]] looks for books on the [[Underdark]] and the [[Demogorgon]]. Glacialmaw looks at books about magical locks. - Mostly on locks in general - Usually magical locks can be dispelled by stronger magic or; - A "key" or item to unlock it [[Virahck]] looks for books about medicine. - Finds some books on basic medicine. - Gleans some insight on broken bones (+1 on broken bone rolls) [[Glacialmaw]] asks for books on blacksmithing and enchanting [[Draxus]] double checks for another copy of [[All the Many Histories of Tapu Ero]]. The attendant replies that they don't have this specific book and the history is a bit fuzzy prior to [[Eroglyf]]. It's not something researched heavily here. Check the general section or the history on [[Eroglyf]]. [[Glacialmaw]] checks about books in Giant. A book of Giant Songwriting. [[Draxus]] searched through the history of Eroglyf and finds a very worn book called _**[[The Great Orc Emperor]]**_ about [[Dal Glug|Dal Glug Par]], the emperor of [[Erog]] ([[Eroglyf]]).

_**The Great Orc Emperor**_ Came from a family of emperors that were wiped out after the invasion. For a time they fought off the invasion, but when the orcs started to lose the war, [[Dal Glug]] grew depressed, and never emerged again.

There isn't much in the book about the pyramids. He resided there in the red pyramid and didn't really leave there. [[Glacialmaw]] reads some nice giant poetry, then puts the book back in the wrong section. We should go check at [[Taylor the Tailor]]'s and get the cloak ASAP. [[Virahck]] trips and falls down the stairs, but thank gods the bag of rats broke his fall. We wait for Taylor to open her shop and then [[Draxus]] purchases a black cloak for 15 gold.
