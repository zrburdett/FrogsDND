### Session Summary


### Log
**BOAT** We decide to sail around [[Prison Isle]]. Do we know how to sail?

_**SET SAIL**_ We go north up the coast of [[Prison Isle]]. Beach overgrowth, seems to be low tide, few birds, squirrels, etc. There's a sudden change in the wind, it's blowing west now.

_**HEADING WEST**_ We start heading towards [[Tapu Ero]], but come across a sunken ship...

**SUNKEN SHIP** Wedged between rocks. Most of the bottom of the boat is underwater, main top area is dry though.

**MAIN DECK** Cabins on either end of the deck. Snapped mast in the center. Waves splashing over the boat. Lower levels are completely underwater. Pool of blood in front of left cabin.

**BLOODPOOL** It's wet - water or fresh?

**LEFT CABIN** [[Klept]] opens the door. Large table, pile of books, papers, stone globe with carvings of different continents, floppy leather hat under the table's leg. Nothing appears to be magic in the room. [[Mo]] takes the hat and puts it on. [[Mo]] finds a set of Navigator's tools - sextant, compass, calipers, rulers, parchment, ink, and quill. [[Glacialmaw]] inspects the globe for similarities between that and the map. [[Kothvush]] makes a rubbing of the globe using [[Glacialmaw]]'s chalk. There are two doors in this cabin. _We move the table..._ Another pool of blood.

**DOOR NUMBER ONE** Small cabin, desk against the window, journal, candlestick, jewelry (two heavy gold bracelets, earrings w/ green gem), bed w/ bedding, large trunk made of wood with a big black padlock. [[Kothvush]] pops open the trunk. Very nice green armor. The green gemstones begin to glow and the armor shines brightly. [[Virahck]] tosses his old chainmail into the boat. [[Hubert Pumpkinpatch's Journal]] reveals he was suspicious of the captain trying to poison him.

_**[[Armor of Gleaming]]**_ Will never get dirty, beautifully clean at all times. Virahck puts on this armor.

**DOOR NUMBER TWO** [[Palu]] falls through the floor into the water underneath! He swims underwater and looks around... Sees some barrels, a large split in the wood where the rock penetrated the ship. We pull up [[Palu]] and [[Kothvush]] jumps in and swims around the bottom area. Dust or something comes out of the barrel. We lift a barrel out of the hole and open it. Looks like sand in the barrels. There are 4 burlap bags in the sand. - 37 gold - white powdery substance [[Mo]] decides to shove some of the powder up his ass. [[Mo]] feels very stimulated. Barrel two - sand and 3 more powder bags. Barrel three - 3 more bags. Barrel four - empty.

_**UNDERWATER HALLWAY**_ Dark as shit.

**ROOM** Blood on the floor, papers and books are water damaged, trail of blood around the floor.

**DOOR** There is a corpse - several stab wounds, pockets turned out. There is a note in his hand that says _PUMPKINPATCH_

**RIGHT CABIN** Lots of tables against the wall, each one with crates (chairs) around them. Small fireplace. Small kitchen with cooking supplies. Set of stairs that go down.

**SHIP TIP** Several holes littered around the front of the ship. Few barrels, chests, a box. [[Klept]] falls through the hole - lands on dry wood.

**UNDERTIP** Spy glass, crates, etc. [[Klept]] grabs the three section spyglass. [[Glacialmaw]] pulls [[Klept]] up.

**SHIP TIP** [[Virahck]] gets a splinter from the barrel but destroys a small box, finding moldy bread. [[Glacialmaw]] mawdogs a barrel and finds a large (3 or 4x the size of normal bag) bag of powder, 6 copper.

**KITCHEN STORES** Barrel, jarred food, stove covered in splatters, cooking utensils, gray apron that used to be white. Salted fish and crackers for dinner!

****LONG REST...?*** [[Kothvush]] watches the moon during first watch. Sees something moving in the water. [[Azurak]] plays their bagpipes during second watch. Feels a set of jaws clamp down on him! 14 pts of damage. [[Kothvush]] wakes everybody up. [[Virahck]] heals [[Azurak]] a bit. We shove the large bag into the captains body and toss it overboard. [[Kothvush]] see a bigass water creature eat the body. The creature does that whale flop thing that they do. It appears to be getting faster... and happy? The thing jumps over the boat and breaks a bit of the deck. It swims over to the boat and starts staring at us. It crawls up onto the boat and rolls on it's back. [[Glacialmaw]] attempts to pet the creature's stomach...
