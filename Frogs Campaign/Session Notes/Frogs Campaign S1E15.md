### Log
_**SPLITTING UP**_ [[Glacialmaw]] and [[Palu]] will to to the library. [[Draxus]], [[Kothvush]], and [[Virahck]] head off to somewhere else to determine it's value.

**LIBRARY** Looking for books on the guild and the government. Asking about _the_ book. They used to have a copy but it went missing months ago, nobody knew where it went. It's quite an old book - the librarian had never read it. It's apparently quite valuable, information could be lost to time if it's not recovered. There wasn't an author listed on the book, so we're unsure if they wrote anything else. At least 100/150 years old - it detailed the country before the civilized groups took over. [[Glacialmaw]] gets interested in writing an index of all books in the library by date. The librarian has heard... certain things about the guild in town.

**GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS/_LEFT PYRAMID_** (twin pyramids)
[[Paelor Sabatons]]
It's rather modern for an old pyramid. There are several attendants behind the desk. We ask about who the keeper of knowledge is. There's a court wizard named [[Anna Philaxus]], the keeper of magical knowledge. Or the head librarian in the library. One of the members in the counsel is very knowledgeable in history, but you'd need a meeting to speak with him. The man flips through the binder and tells us the Counselman is booked but can do 15 minutes in 40 days! Anna could see you tomorrow afternoon and the head librarian is probably on shift now! The right pyramid does the same sort of things, but worse.

_**RIGHT PYRAMID**_ It's the same as the left pyramid, but mirrored. "Good thing you came to the right pyramid!" We ask about knowledge keepers. The court wizard is a left pyramid type of person, so we don't deal with that. The counsel chambers for the [[Counsel of Masters]] are here. Their staff quarters are here, too. Officials also. [[Virahck]] baits the right pyramid with "incriminating evidence" on the left pyramid bros. Head of construction is a right pyramid man - who has availability in 3 hours.

**GLUMIEZ**
[[Glumiez]]
We regroup and chat. We start chatting with [[Joseph]]. I'm not permitted to know all about it, but they're interested in the [[Red Pyramid]] and the book has certain information about it. He's been told he can't get inside. [[Joseph]] doesn't like any government officials, but if he had to choose, he would lean right.

_**CONSTRUCTION MAN MEETING**_ [[Bob the Builder]] will see you now, [[Virahck]]. [[Virahck]] made a diagram of the bridge written in blood in the back of [[Hubert Pumpkinpatch's Journal]]. There's a lot of divisiveness between pyramids and a bridge between the two would help "bridge the gap," so to speak. "Is this blood?" "It's an interesting idea, but the counsel probably doesn't want to use the budget considering there are tunnels to connect the pyramids and it's already very close together." [[Virahck]] tells [[Bob the Builder]] about the book and gets referred to the library.

_**REGROUP**_ We consider going to [[Orcida]] to learn about the cultural significance of the book.

_**BOOK TALK**_ They had possession of the book for several days, but it was stolen from the libraries. A few members of the guild did in fact read the book. [[Toeseph]] goes off to bring one of them. [[Broseph]] comes over and tells of the book. [[Broseph]] read the book - it detailed the past histories of the city, and the Orcish rule before it was taken over by the [[Counsel of Masters]]. I get the impression the book was written by someone part of the invading force. Written in common and tends to side with the invading forces. Not exactly a statement of fact, but it pertains to something we're researching - the former emperor of [[Tapu Ero]], [[Dal Glug|Dal Glug Par]]. We have no confirmation, but a former guild member did disappear at the same as the book - [[Rickon]]. He's a very strange man with an obsession with rats. Quite intelligent, we were interested in his knowledge. I don't mean to make any accusations but it's an interesting coincidence. He singlehandedly kept [[Darcy's Pets]] open for quite a while with his rat purchases. The book must speak about the pyramids right, [[Broseph]]? The book does touch on the pyramids but not in detail. It focuses on the [[Red Pyramid]], considering it was the palace of [[Dal Glug]]. The pyramids were here long before the [[Counsel of Masters]] were. Tbh, we don't care about the other ones. [[Broseph]] likes the left pyramid better. They are looking for a specific artifact that might be inside of the [[Red Pyramid]], we're hoping the book would give us some knowledge about it. The doors have been locked by the counsel, but there are probably ways past the lock, but haven't made it to that point where our expert lock maker would take a peek. The counsel is restricting access to the pyramid, but the orcs may have put a lock on themselves. The artifact could be worth well over 1,000 gold. I can't tell you about the artifact, but you must sign a contract with the guild first.

_**THE LOCKSMITH - Loeksmift**_ We ask him about magic locks in general. I have this tool... [[Broseph]] informed me of the project and it seems valuable enough to use this for. He goes away and returns with a small dagger and says "This is a [[Penknife of Unlocking]]. It should cut through the magical barrier and open the door." I've only had one of these before, but it broke on use. [[Guild]] prefers the left pyramid.

_**THE REVEAL - Solo [[Draxus]]**_ We have had the book this whole time but were scared of you, heh. - [[Draxus]] It is fair to be wary of the guild, I appreciate your honesty. Keep the knowledge of what you're doing in the pyramid, keep it on the downlow. Don't name us until after we finish the job. I could provide some health potions.

_**THE GROUP REVEAL**_ [[Draxus]] says they offer us 350 gold for the book. We head back to [[Glumiez]] for a while and wait for the cover of darkness to head to the red pyramid.

**RED PYRAMID**
[[Red Pyramid]]
The [[Penknife of Unlocking]] works in the lock and we pull open the door. We walk in and prop open the door. Intricate hall, dark red carpeting, very regal and beautiful place. We follow the carpet. As we walk, we see several indentations in the walls that look like where doors used to be, but have been sealed with stone - it appears to be different stone than the pyramid is made of, must be newer and added much later. [[Glacialmaw]] notices an indentation in a wall - secret door!

_**SECRET ROOM**_ Small sleeping quarters. Small cot with moldy linens, small side table with ashes. Diary with a coin purse - 14 gold.

_**RED PYRAMID DIARY**_ It's written in Orcish.

**TWIN DOORS** Two large pointed spikes instead of door handle, with a crusty brown substance on the end of it. The door and the spikes glow when Palu [[Detect Magic|detects magic]]. We skewer two rats ([[Palu]] and [[Draxus]]) on the spikes. When blood makes contact with the spikes, the doors swing backwards, opening to a large chamber.

_**CHAMBER**_ At the end of the hall, we see some light, but can't tell anything yet. It's just a _huge_ room with tall columns on either side. We reach a point in the room where there are two very ornate sarcophagi on either side of the walls. There is Orcish written on the walls and the sarcophagi. We come across two more after the next set of pillars. We hear the sound of breaking wood... and mummies emerge!

_**COMBAT**_ [[Draxus]] lights a mummy on fire and it's wraps start to burn. We fuck 'em up.

**MASOLEUM** It's big and beautiful. Top chest: 6 gold bars, 12 silver bars, twin pair of golden rings Bottom chest: pitch black onyx stone, flat on the top and bottom [[Virahck]] picks it up and the world twists away, he finds himself in an endless grass field. _**ENDLESS GRASS FIELD**_ A massive man made of stone approaches, stoops down, and stares right at you, very closely. A gentle voice says "Find on the day that is shortest, sin, outside and in, flee before the end begins." Then he is suddenly back in the pyramid.

_**STUNNING COFFIN**_ Carved wooden face, round face, tusks, painted wood stands upright out of the coffin, locking it. Safe bet that it's the emperor. When [[Draxus]] sees the coffin, he feels an overwhelming urge to see what's inside of it. He swings at the wooden key, then removes the piece of wood and opens the coffin. There's a pale gaunt orc with a similar face on the coffin. There is still flesh on the orc. It doesn't seem magic, but as [[Palu]] steps up, he awakens, bites [[Palu]], and then the orc turns into a bat and flies out of the burial chamber.
