### Session Summary
After dropping off those refugees we met at sea, we make our way past the western edge of [[Lyniys]], seeing the islands of [[Yidi]] and [[Scaramar]] in the distance. The weather down here is much more temperate and warm as compared to the cold temperatures that are getting into the northern continents by this point in the year.

As we dock [[Lightning McQueen]] on the eastern side of [[Scaramar]], we notice see a ship sailing away, heading east towards [[Yidi]], flying a flag with a gray fish leaping out of a blue barreling wave.

We enter the island and are approached by a group of guards, who eventually agree to give us temporary access to the island once we reveal our connections with the [[Shadow of the Knife]].

We're told this chapter of the [[Shadow of the Knife]] is led by Commander [[Dain Nashula]] and this area is rich in [[Shadow of the Knife]] history, including how the founder of the organization, [[Renwick]], has lived on these islands for many many years, but only the [[Shadow of the Knife|Shadow]] remains on the island of [[Scaramar]].

We begin walking through the dense forest at the direction of [[Dain Nashula]], who shows us the netting on the canopy of the trees that blocks out the direct sunlight, and tells us of the pygmy marmosets that live in the branches, munching on [[Writtle Fruit]] all day.

We're told the [[Writtle Trees]] are native to the [[Andees]] Islands in general, but only remain growing on [[Scaramar]] due to [[Yuri Dimitri]]'s aggressive deforestation in the name of construction on the other islands in the [[Andees]]. Despite [[Yuri Dimitri|Yuri]]'s intent on cutting down the trees for lumber and to make room for crops, he was obsessed with the [[Writtle Fruit]] - legend has it that if you eat 1,000 red fruit, you'll gain unbelievable magical power. [[Yuri Dimitri]] conquered the [[Andees]] under the name **The Floating Isles** about 1,200 years ago - he's probably buried on [[Yidi]], the capital city.

When [[Draxus]] tastes one of the [[Writtle Fruit]], he tells us of it's bitter taste and the friendly warmth and tingling that passes through his body with each bite. It's a very filling fruit so people can only last a few bites at a time.

We're told more about [[Renwick]] and how she is still alive and resides on [[Scaramar]]. We're reminded that she comes from the island of [[Be]] and was one of the strongest hunters in her village, but one day, many of those in her community were killed by vampire who turned into a red bat. The next time she would run into the vampire in another attack on another village, it attacked her, causing immense pain and eventually turning her into a dhampir about 1,500 years ago. Ever since then, she has made it her duty to avenge her village by founding the [[Shadow of the Knife]], to kill vampires and stop their creation once and for all.

We make it to a stone mausoleum with a portal of sorts and are told that members of the [[Shadow of the Knife]] can pass through this doorway, but non-members will have to remain outside. We are then reunited with [[Caedmon Thorne]], but [[Ebu Tart]] seems like she's had enough, so she gives us the finger before retreating through the portal.

[[Caedmon Thorne|Caedmon]] tells us that the [[Palebank]] sect successfully made it here to [[Scaramar]] and we begin speaking about the [[Keys of the Beast]] and the potential to release [[The Beast]]. An elf woman with black eyes and black hair overhears us and tells us to be careful when considering to release it. She identifies herself as [[Renwick]].

We eventually come to the decision that locating the [[Keys of the Beast]] is a shared goal between our groups and we decide to make a partnership of sorts. She gives us information about killing vampires and then we move onto the topic of [[Dal Glug]].

We are told that it's very rare for a vampire to be created due to the frenzy for dominance, and [[Renwick]] is concerned about potential collaboration between vampires, which would cause further spread of the epidemic - it's rather likely that the [[Guild]] is aiding the vampires and is participating in [[Dal Glug]]'s dominance campaign.

We're given more information about [[Renwick]]'s rival - the red bat. He has evaded capture for millennia and has a vast wealth of knowledge and discretion, revealing that he was previously seen once in [[Yi]] and once in [[Bastoria]]. He has a kind face and is missing a finger on his left hand - his name is [[Damien]].

We also learn that the origin of lizardfolk is in the [[Andees]], with leadership based in the [[Kidneys]]. We should also make our way to [[Orcida]].

[[Renwick]] clues us in on the business arrangement between [[Scaramar]] and the rest of the islands in the [[Andees]], where the [[Shadow of the Knife]] exchanges [[Writtle Fruit]] for fresh blood for consumption, but lately, the quality of the blood has drastically decreased even though the amount of fruit required has only increased. She would like us to discretely look into the [[Authority]] government, specifically her contact, [[Incash Gurzarita]].

Finally, before [[Renwick]] respectfully kicks us off [[Scaramar]], she provides a number of items to the party to help us on our journey.

### Log
We can see [[Yidi]] and [[Scaramar]] as we pass around the western edge of [[Lyniys]]. The climate is a lot warmer than it was in the [[Wishbones]]. It's fall but it's still warm. This is a temperate/tropical rainforest.

There's a thick lush forest on [[Scaramar]]. There's a long dock poking out from the eastern edge of the island. We don't see people on the dock, but we do see a ship sailing away from [[Scaramar]] heading east towards [[Yidi]]. The ship flying a flag with a gray fish leaping out of a blue barreling wave. We dock [[Lightning McQueen]].

A group of dark steel clad 5 or 6 carrying halberds and one carries a war hammer. We inquire about getting access to the island, stating that we have connections with the [[Shadow of the Knife]]. The pale skinned woman with the war hammer asks us about who we are with. [[Dain Nashula]] is the commander of the guards for the [[Shadow of the Knife]] on [[Scaramar]].

[[Renwick]] lived here on the surrounding islands before making the trek across the channel to [[Scaramar]]. It's never been a common place to live and nobody else has lived here in quite a while. [[Dain Nashula]] leads us towards the forest.

We see a 30 foot tall cobblestone tower, but it's been painted to blend in with the surrounding forest. There's an additional 10 guards or so at the bottom of the tower. There's like 40 barrels that appear to be filled with liquid - lots and lots of liquid.

[[Draxus]] sees several pairs of eyes in the trees, but can't really tell what he's looking at before they disappear. There's a thick net in the trees that block out most of the bright sky. Draxus inquires, but [[Dain Nashula]] tells him about the pygmy marmosets, the only other inhabitants on the island. They're rather tricky creatures.

All the trees appear to be the same kind of red fruit high up in the trees. They are [[Writtle Trees]] - native to the [[Andees]], but they haven't grown on the other islands in many many years. Many people love the fruit, but it's kind of a bitter flavor. They are considered a staple of the [[Andees]]. There's a deal with some governments on the other islands where the fruit doesn't grow anymore.

[[Writtle Trees]] covered the [[Andees]] - they were very important to the ecosystem, but about 1200 years ago, a man named [[Yuri Dimitri]] conquered the island and cut down the trees for construction. They block out all of the light on the ground, so crops can't be grown. Yuri never conquered [[Scaramar]] so the trees thrived. All attempts to grow [[Writtle Trees]] anywhere else have failed. Something has changed about the land since they were removed. They rarely make it past seedling and are stunted for small and flavorless fruit when planted elsewhere. Quite famously, [[Yuri Dimitri]] was obsessed with the fruit and legend has it that if you eat 1,000 red fruit, you'll gain unbelievable magical power. We can only really see 10 at a time or so. [[Yuri Dimitri]] founded the [[Andees]] under the name the **Floating Isles**. He probably died of old age. He's probably buried on [[Yidi]] - that's the capital city.

[[Draxus]] introduces himself as he sends an [[Eldritch Blast]] to get his hands on a red fruit. He takes a bite. It has a rich, bitter taste. It's rather shocking how sharp the sensation is. It burns and tingles. Then comes a friendly warmth and travels down his throat. He feels the tingling throughout his body and it feels heavy. It's very filling.

[[Renwick]] is still alive and is here on the island. She comes from the island of [[Be]] and was the matriarch of the village, as one of the stronger hunters. They trapped small game, hunted elk, etc. One day, she came back to find a shadowy figure transform into a red bat standing over the corpses of her fellow villagers. She realized it was a vampire and has been unsuccessful to find the red bat. She witnessed another assault on another village that had another run in with the red bat. This time, she was attacked by the figure. She should have died but she laid there for days and days, bleeding out and waiting for death. Something about the fury within her kept her functioning, even without blood. After many days, she rose from the mud and settled in [[Scaramar]] 1,500 years ago or so. Her goal is still to find the red bat to avenge her village and the other villages. Part of the oath for the [[Shadow of the Knife]] is to kill vampires and stop their creation.

After about 40 minutes of walking, we make it to a clearing. In the center, there's a structure resembling a mausoleum. There's a carving of a door in the slab of stone. [[Dain Nashula]] tells us about the [[Tree's Shadow]]. There's a small gazebo made of painted white wood. It's almost comically out of place. [[Ebu Tart]] and [[Urgon Walfa]] can come through the door, but only [[Shadow of the Knife]] members can enter through the door. The other guards will retrieve [[Renwick]].

[[Ebu Tart]] flips us off as she passes through the stone and disappears.

[[Caedmon Thorne]] and his collective did indeed make it here to [[Scaramar]]. He arrived 5 weeks ago. We could retrieve him as well.

A short, slim figure follows and an even shorter figure with a cane approaches us. [[Caedmon Thorne]] embraces [[Urgon Walfa]] and thanks us for bringing him back safely.

About a week after we had left [[Palebank]], someone warned of a delivery ship from the [[Guild]] carrying pale skinned men and women on their way to [[Palebank]]. It was a strategic decision to group up in the south to prepare for war. A vampire can't cross your threshold into your house without permission, so the [[Shadow of the Knife]] would be safe in the mausoleum, but everyone else would be out of luck. [[Draxus]] pulls out [[King Fleshbarg's Key]] and tells about [[The Beast]] and our possibility to get involved.

An elf woman with black eyes and black hair. Veins cover her body with brown lines of what used to be veins. She speaks, "I know what you speak of. [[The Beast]] is larger than all of [[Scaramar]] and blocked out all of the sunlight. I can't imagine what else would be able to stop the vampire plague. I'm hesitant to release it." She introduces herself as [[Renwick]].

[[Palu]] introduces herself and explains her affliction to [[Renwick]]. [[Palu]] tells of her attack by a vampire who then transitioned into a bat. [[Renwick]] subtly comments on [[Palu]]'s giant breasts.

[[Renwick]] asks what she can do for us before explaining that only [[Shadow of the Knife]] members can remain on the island. She and the others give us some space to discuss payment.

[[Palu]] considers joining the [[Shadow of the Knife]]. [[Renwick]] and [[Dain Nashula]] finish up their conversation, but we hear words like "shipment" and "worsening quality." [[Palu]] speaks up while [[Glacialmaw]] casts [[Guidance]]. [[Renwick]] allows [[Palu]] to join the [[Shadow of the Knife]], but requests that she complete her transition before undertaking the ceremony. If you are to be on retainer, then you will have to have some additional responsibilities.

Finding the keys is a shared goal. If you wish to leave [[King Fleshbarg's Key]], we will keep it safe. [[Renwick]] can provide equipment or gold, gemstones, etc. There is much to learn in the [[Andees]]. Are you familiar with all of the ways to kill a vampire? Daylight, sunlight to burn a vampire quickly, holy water to burn them, running water such as a river has a limited effect, a stake to the heart at their resting place will incapacitate a vampire. One of the most important details is that they can regenerate quite quickly. Light and water can prevent it, but they are devious and can be ready for another battle in an hour. If the body changes, make sure whatever it changes into doesn't fly away or it likely isn't dead. It's better to separate vampires into single fights. They are fairly intelligent, but they are vampires first and foremost. Their drive for blood and feasts will motivate their urges.

[[Dal Glug]] was known to be a very calm and collected man. [[Renwick]] is quite curious as to his creation. It's very rare for one vampire to create another as the spawn will often fight for dominance. She is concerned about a collaboration between vampires, causing further spread. It's very likely the [[Guild]] is participating in [[Dal Glug]]'s dominance. [[Tapu Ero]] is certainly lost - avoid it if you can.

There is one vampire still lingering on the [[Andees]] - the red bat. He has evaded for millennia and has a vast wealth of knowledge and discretion. After all these years, [[Renwick]] knows very little about him. She anticipates a struggle to find him. She has seen him twice - once in [[Yi]] and another time in [[Bastoria]]. He has a kind face and is missing a finger on his left hand. There were legends of a monster kidnapping children in the [[Andees]] - his name is [[Damien]].

The origin of lizardfolk are actually in the [[Andees]] - head towards the [[Kidneys]], their leaders may have information. Probably worth going to [[Orcida]] to assist in the endeavor. Many gnomes live there as well.

[[Renwick]] asks for assistance. In exchange for the red fruit, the main governments provide a large amount of blood for consumption on [[Scaramar]]. The quality of the blood has been decreasing over time, and while we can still consume it, we are losing a lot of our true strength in whatever deficiency. There has come an imbalance - quality of blood has decreased and amount of fruit has only increased. [[Renwick]] would like us to discretely look into this issue. Few citizens are aware of the dhampir population. The [[Authority]] is the government that [[Renwick]] has been working with, specifically [[Incash Gurzarita]].

[[Renwick]] will provide us with sending stones and some magical equipment to aid in our journey. [[Virahck]] gets a [Vicious Longbow](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Vicious%20Longbow#content), [[Kothvush]] gets two [Moon Touched](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:moon-touched-sword) [Kamas](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Kamas.jpg), [[Glacialmaw]] gets a [Frozen Star](<https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Frozen_Star_(5e_Equipment)>). [[Palu]] also gets a [Pearl of Power](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4691-pearl-of-power). [[Draxus]] got a [Cloak of Protection](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Cloak%20of%20Protection#content).

"If that's all the information and equipment, respectfully, please leave [[Scaramar]]," [[Renwick]] explains.
