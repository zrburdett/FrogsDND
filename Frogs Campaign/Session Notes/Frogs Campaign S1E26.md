### Session Summary


### Log
[[Glacialmaw]] _DIES_. _**COMBAT OVER**_ [[Ebu Tart]] revives [[Glacialmaw]] after several of us provide her with valuable items. We think they must've fled rather than been killed here. There's a loft with a bed, table covered in papers and books. The books appear to be... rather uninteresting. BUT there's a journal about the history of the [[Shadow of the Knife]].

_**SHADOW OF THE KNIFE HISTORY**_
*Table of Contents*
Founding of the [[Shadow of the Knife]]
Early Days
Recent Years

**FOUNDING** Fairly thick, first section. Explains how the [[Shadow of the Knife]] has been around for thousands of years, before dates were really tracked. Originally, there was [[Renwick]], a young huntress who led some others from her tribe. She was the matriarch and was responsible for dozens of the race that would eventually become elves. They trapped small game. She would find the remains of her slaughtered friends and family in the town, seeing a shadowy figure standing over them - then eventually changed forms into a red bat, flying away into the night. Swore an oath to kill the people who killed their families. _**Never to rest until the only shadow that remains is the shadow of her own knife.**_ Members separated from [[Renwick]] and settled separately. [[Renwick]] continued by herself, sleeping in the dirt, going without food for many days - completely isolated. After searching, she witnessed another assault on a village - she was eating in a small tavern in the [[Andees]], then she saw the same red bat shift into humanoid form, trying to kill him, but it simply laughed and then bit her, drank her blood, killing her while the rest of that village was slaughtered. [[Renwick]] should have died (maybe she did?) but the drive for revenge kept her body functioning. After many days, she rose from the mud. Her pain only grew. She found other survivors across the island and across the world, and now continues to lead the [[Shadow of the Knife]] in [[Scaramar]].

**RECENT YEARS** There are sects of the [[Shadow of the Knife]] across the islands, most on [[Scaramar]]. [[Caedmon Thorne]] is the leader in one area. There's a settlement in [[Eroglyf]]. No note in [[Orcida]].

_**OFF TO OSPLETT'S GATE**_ We arrive at [[Osplett's Gate]] and begin searching for our boat. Glacialmaw goes to the bank to exchange them for coinage. He heads off to the gem store. [[Draxus]] says yes to the dress (cloak).
