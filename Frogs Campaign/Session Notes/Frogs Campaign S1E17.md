### Session Summary


### Log
_**LOOT**_ - [[Lightning McQueen]], the boat - Collection of religious tomes about the goddess of winter [[Auril]] - Preserved organs in jars - Huge egg the size of a human's chest, cold to the touch - Large stone tablets with carvings on them, life size people - Sugar - 300 gold

**Stone tablets** A gold coin sigil with a tree on it - [[Guild]]'s sigil About 10 of these stone tablets with screaming and crying people carved into them We think the pirates may have been transporting these items for the guild.

**White Substance** Strong smelling spices. [[Draxus]] tastes the substance... it's sugar.

**CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS** Bed, desk, map, ledgers ([[Guild|Guild]] sigil) with instructions to deliver to [[Sorflow]] from [[Yidi]].

**[[Auril]] - _The Goddess of Winter_** Beautiful woman made of ice and snow, winter's wrath. Worshipped in northern lands. [[Glacialmaw]] is familiar and knows people who worshipped [[Auril]].

**Considerations:** - Through [[Kohdor Lake]] via mostly water - Through [[Osplett's Gate]] via mostly land - Through [[Sorflow]] via half land and half water

_**TRAVELING for FOUR DAYS**_ Safe sailing, but the further north we travel, the colder it gets. We arrive at the bay near [[Osplett's Gate]]. The river is wide enough for two or three ships at a time. We see thin strips of ice on either side of the river, but not reaching too far into the center. We head down the river and reach [[Osplett's Gate]]. A wall wraps around the city and there is a port with ships coming and going.

**DOCKING** We pull into the port and are approached with a clipboard. He asks what company we work for and what goods we are delivering. We tell them that this boat was under attack by pirates, fought off the pirates, and the entire crew died and we did a sea burial. He is thoroughly convinced. He tells us to move the ship to the port of the port, just 10 gold for a week, 25 for a month. We give him a gold bar to give us complete discretion and secrecy. We hand him the Orcish book and he tells us it is about [[Dal Glug]] from [[Tapu Ero]]. It was written by a servant. The book is about the day to day life of the servant in the [[Red Pyramid]] who worked for the emperor. It describes the changing tides of war - it's quite positive about the emperor, but at the end, there's a drastic change in [[Dal Glug]]'s personality and behavior. Reclusive and removed, less interested in the success of the orcs... He seemed sickly at a time, pale skin, cold body. He never left the palace after that. The servant accuses [[Dal Glug]] of killing another servant, but the book ends abruptly.

**OSPLETT'S GATE**
[[Osplett's Gate]]
We don't find any magic shops. [[Glacialmaw]] asks a 9 year old girl where we can find a magic item shop. She tells us there is one in [[Osplett's Gate]], then screams and runs away when [[Glacialmaw]] tells her that trolls eat children. [[Glacialmaw]] asks another person - she respond that there's one right over her shoulder.

**WHISPERS OF THE PAST**
[[Whispers of the Past]]
Antique shop. It's pretty empty since it's late. There's a small male gnome. We inquire about a bag of holding. He has one, but it costs quite a bit. [[Virahck]] goes to reup on rations for us all. This small gnome says the bag is worth 5,000 gold.

_**WHISPERING OUTSIDE**_ _"Do we kill him?"_ - [[Palu]] We consider giving him a look into his future to drive the price down. He's also interested in the rock of detect gravity, [[Virahck]] would also throw in the [[Unlucky Rabbit's Foot|"lucky" rabbit's foot]]. He's intrigued at the look into the future. He demonstrates the bag of holding. He touches the stone and is stunned at what he saw. Speechless.

_**GRABBING FOOD @ FOOD CARTS**_

_**SLEEP IN THE SHIP**_ [[Virahck]] gets the Captain's Quarters, the rest of us head to the hammocks.

_**THE PORT IS POPPIN'**_ Many boats are having crates of things being loaded onto them. Mostly metals from the mountains. It seems several of the crates being loaded have [[Guild]]'s logo - infrequent, but more than 3 or 4 times. [[Glacialmaw]] buys a fishing rod. We try and give the stableman some money for 2 lizards.

_**TO ULITH PASS**_ Mountains get taller and taller and the landscape looks very rough now.

_**THE VALLEY OF THE BONES**_ [[Virahck]] gets hit by 2 massive rocks. Maybe a troll or a giant... We hear loud and heavy footsteps. It's probably a giant. [[Palu]] tosses four magic missiles.

_**COMBAT**_ It's a giant! [[Draxus]] casts [[Mirror Image]] and four of him are visible. We kill the giant and loot it:
- Fox carcass
- Rocks
_There are two more stone giants coming our way..._ [[Virahck]] attempts to daze the giant into confusion by throwing our _[[Glimpsing Gem|priceless artifact]]_ at it. [[Virahck]] winds up and discus throws it as hard as he can - it ends up hitting [[Ebu Tart]] and she is knocked prone. We finally kill the other two and find:
- Bone knife
- Bone jewelry
- Notebook with very interesting perspectives
- Chisel
