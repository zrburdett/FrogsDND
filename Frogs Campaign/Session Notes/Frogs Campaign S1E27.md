### Log
##### _**THE DOCKS**_
The docks are rather busy, groups of people getting on ships with luggage - many people are leaving. People seem to be in a hurry. There was an attack in [[Sorflow]], people have been fleeing to [[Osplett's Gate]] and chartering boats to get away. It was about a week ago - large group of people came down the river in ships and attacked the city. Smaller than an army, but around 50-100 people showed up and destroyed property, killed people, tore people apart. No known affiliation. It was during the evening, the sun was down when they passed the village on the outskirts. Massive end of the year festival in the [[Andees]] in a few weeks - The Fortnite in [[Yidi]]. We head towards our boat. [[Virahck]] cuts the rope that "guards" our boat from commoners - and this attracts attention. [[Draxus]] conceals his identity and pretends to be a dockworker.

##### _**UNDOCK**_
We head through the short river to get out to sea. We see a large chunk of ice with a woman frozen in it. The ice is rather cubic and the woman looks surprised. [[Palu]] starts melting the ice with his [[Wand of Burning Hands]], and makes some progress but not enough. She isn't totally dead, but her thoughts are scattered:

>[!info] Thoughts
>She is leaving from an island, being on a ship, she gets shipwrecked, hands reaching from the water, and coldness approaching... until the images repeat.

We got the ice from the water!

##### _**GIANT'S HEEL**_
[[Giant's Heel]]
Large bluff 150 feet tall, there are no trees, only a smooth stone. To the north of the bluff, we can see the beginnings of the [[Towering Forest]]. We park the boat and hop into the dinghy. The trees are fucking massive. Green leaves and brown branches, massive root system that you need to climb over. Tons and tons of leaves and pine needles. The clouds are as high as the top of the trees. Though smaller than the [[Ohara Tree]], they are massive. [[Urgon Walfa]] says there's a colony of giants in the center of the forest.

##### _**POND**_
A beautiful scene, 30 ft around the pond, a slow "boil" the water is bubbling, and the bubbles float up towards the trees. Little splashes of rainbow hovering around the mist. This feels ethereal. It feels very good in the water. [[Draxus]] is all the way in now. We set up camp for the night.

##### _**KOTHVUSH'S DREAM**_
As you start honing in on [[Kothvush]]’s dreams, an image of a lush forest beside a bustling metropolis begins to come into focus. There are two figures ahead, walking on a dirt path along the side of a mountain that overlooks the city. The path is rather overgrown with vegetation and it doesn’t look like anybody has been here in a long while. You start to close the gap between yourself and the two humanoids, as you get closer, you can see the figures more clearly now. You recognize the bluish-purple hue and bald head that is unmistakably reminiscent of the [[Vedalken]] race. When you get close enough, you can hear the two of them talking amongst themselves, seemingly laughing and having a pleasant conversation. As you look the two of them over, you recognize a mace that is dangling from the belt of one of them - you’ve seen this mace before, wielded by [[Kothvush]] during your travels across the ocean, on [[Tapu Ero]], and in the [[Wishbones]]. [[Kothvush]] seems a lot younger here than he is now - both in appearance, but also in demeanor. There is more of a playful aspect to the way he speaks and moves, in contrast with the grim and reserved look in his eyes that you’re used to. The two of them keep walking, paying no attention to you as if you aren’t even there. Eventually, the path you all are walking on gets to be harder and harder to see. The distinguishable dirt path has been replaced by a narrow clearing of trees, and as you keep walking, it’s as if there is no more path at all. The two figures, who used to appear determined about the direction they were headed, now appear not so sure, looking around a lot more, almost confused about where to head next.

As they wander the forest steadily inclining in altitude, [[Uthvish|the Vedalken walking with Kothvush]] stops and lightly bumps [[Kothvush]] with his arm, before pointing past some trees on your left. The two of them start walking towards whatever has caught the [[Uthvish|other Vedalken]]’s eye and you continue to follow. You reach a natural rock wall, but as you get closer, the [[Uthvish|other Vedalken]] reaches towards the rock and pulls away the overgrown shrubbery, vines, and ivy, revealing an incredible carving into the stone. It seems to be an ornate design of a thick band swirling along the wall. As [[Kothvush]] and the [[Uthvish|other Vedalken]] continue to pull away the vines, a previously hidden hole in the wall is uncovered - turns out the large bands were a border surrounding the opening. The two Vedalken look at each other and you see a burning curiosity in their eyes. [[Kothvush]] takes the lead and begins stepping into the opening of the cave, closely followed by the [[Uthvish|other Vedalken]]. As you attempt to step inside along with them, your vision gets hazy and the image of the dream begins to fade.

##### _**THE NEXT DAY**_
[[Draxus]] examines the bubbles further, and the bubble doesn't pop immediately. He sees a reflection just like where we're standing, but the reflection seems to be getting larger and larger. [[Draxus]]' body stretched and his face morphs and the rest of his body enters the bubble. When he emerges, the place looks the same, but the water is a mix of pinks and greens, with the yellow flowers seem to be one color, but if you focus, they change color. The trees are the same, but they're wriggling and dancing as he tries to focus. The sun shining down no longer seems like morning sun, but more like just before twilight. He sees a crooked old woman scrubbing on a washboard with the swirling water. She doesn't seem surprised, and smiles at [[Draxus]], before asking where he came from. "I didn't notice you walk up. It's good to meet you. My name is [[Janus]], but you can call me Granny - all my friends do. Are you alone here? This is where I wash my clothes - my home is not far from here. This is the best place to wash clothes because the water seems to clean itself. I've got some fish cooking in the oven, if you're hungry." [[Glacialmaw]] does the same thing to the bubble and is transported as well. The rest of us follow suit.
