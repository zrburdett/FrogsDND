### Session Summary
After a day full of shopping and suspicious activities at the [[Prying Pumpkin]], the party meets up at the bank and considers what to do next. We ultimately decide that checking out the [[Dreaming of Dirigibles]] port will be the best use of our time, considering we still need to find most of the [[Keys of the Beast]].

On the way, we encounter some of the shops at the Southern Market, including a jerky booth for some turkey jerky, which takes "sort of like a savory banana," and a costume booth for makeup and costumes - [[Virahck]] changes into gay Robin Hood and we make our way to [[Dreaming of Dirigibles]], but not before hitting up [[Feat for a Curse]], which [[Draxus]] and [[Glacialmaw]] take up.

Upon arriving at [[Dreaming of Dirigibles]], we learn that there are only two ports currently set up - one here in [[Yi]] and another in [[Orcida]]. We also learn that [[Dreaming of Dirigibles]] is a joint effort between the [[Church of Abertai]] and the Emperor of [[Orcida]]. The employee informs us that they are raffling off their older model dirigible, the [[Belligerent Dirigibent]], to festival goers, so a few of us purchase some tickets - the drawing will be held tomorrow at 3pm.

On our way back to the center of the city, we encounter a large line at the [[Prying Pumpkin]], which we learn is a business focused on acquiring and returning rare and lost items throughout the land. Those in line are waiting for a consultation, but there is also a shop within that has a variety of trinkets and whatnot.

Upon entering the shop, [[Draxus]] makes some moves and discretely makes his way into the employees only section to look at the six floor building and what might be contained within. He finds a room with a variety of different types of orbs (and he breaks one with a hat rat...), another room with a ton of different types of bones, and another room with a strange altar with symbols carved into it. There is a locked trapdoor in the corner as well.

Meanwhile, the rest of the party remains in the shop of the [[Prying Pumpkin]], attempting to maintain the attention of the real employees so [[Draxus]] doesn't get found out.

[[Draxus]] continues his sleuthing in the [[Prying Pumpkin]]'s back rooms, finding a library type area on the third floor, and a cubicle setup on the fourth floor. He sees a map with a location marked for what appears to be one of those rare items so he swipes it. On the sixth floor, [[Draxus]] only sees a single room at the end of the hallway, so he enters cautiously.

Inside is a huge penthouse office with a man with wavy blond hair sitting at a wooden desk, petting his cat. The man, who is missing his pointer finger, questions [[Draxus]] about why he is up here and that he is not allowed to be on the sixth floor. He tells [[Draxus]] that he is the owner of the [[Prying Pumpkin]] and that he needs to leave *now*.

[[Draxus]] bolts for the exit but encounters many guards on the way, one of which manages to tear a large chunk from his magical cloak. [[Draxus]] eventually makes it to the altar room and breaks the lock off of the trapdoor before going down into the depths of the dark stone staircase. Losing count after about 7 or 8 floors worth of steps, he eventually finds himself in a blinding light due to the torch on the wall - his curse from [[Feat for a Curse]] was that fire causes blinding light and he cannot see.

As all of this is happening, [[Virahck]], in an attempt to distract the guards, yells out that [[Glacialmaw]] Trundlemain is here in the shop, causing many of the patrons to lunge at him for the 1,000 gold reward. This commotion leads to a half dozen civilians being smacked by [[Glacialmaw]] and [[Kothvush]] tries to get them all out of there by using his Hour of Reaping, frightening many people in the process. In response to the violence, about 20 guards surround the entrance of the [[Prying Pumpkin]], leaving [[Kothvush]] and [[Glacialmaw]] stuck inside, with [[Virahck]] and [[Palu]] able to get away due to all of the confusion.

Down back with [[Draxus]], he is able to find the torch on the wall and extinguish it, revealing about a dozen locked cells filled with weak looking people. When [[Draxus]] hears the guards coming towards him, he sacrifices a man missing his legs to summon some demons to help ward off the guards. Unfortunately for him, the door behind him seals up and he is now trapped in what appears to be some type of area with holding cells. With nothing to do, he desummons the demons and lets the rest of the prisoners out of their cells. They are clearly very frightened because [[Draxus]] just murdered the legless old man, but eventually one of them speaks to him, telling him that all of these people were "requested" by customers of the [[Prying Pumpkin]] but have yet to "claim" them or pay up, so to speak. [[Draxus]] attempts to look for a way out, but isn't met with very many options...

### Log
It's about 2 or 3 in the afternoon and we meet up at the bank. We consider going to check out [[Dreaming of Dirigibles]], especially if we need the [[Keys of the Beast]]. [[Draxus]] tells us some of the story about how he... ran away from the [[Prying Pumpkin]]'s back room in quite the hurry. [[Palu]] and [[Glacialmaw]] inform [[Draxus]] of the bank excursion, which is good because we may need the funds for a dirigible trip.

There's a booth selling pies, a booth of long rests.

We consider getting the [[Lizardfolk's Key]] in the [[Kidneys]] then swing back up before the festival ends, ultimately then taking a dirigible up to [[Orcida]]. We head off to the southern market.

There are a lot of smaller buildings with various shops. There's a large dirt field filled with a bunch of stalls and booths. There are a few groups of lizardfolk every so often and a jerky booth maintained by some lizardfolk.

The jerky booth sells turkey jerky. [[Draxus]] tries some and... doesn't like it. "It's sort of like a savory banana." he says. Their family is from The Neck. The [[Kidneys]] are not recommended for visiting because the native lizardfolk aren't fond of visitors. We won't exactly get killed, but we might get mugged or a bit worse. There's the Willem Tribe, the Zorg Tribe. The river between the [[Kidneys]] is the Tube and there are very likely settlements surrounding the lakes of the [[Kidneys]]. We decide to look at options to get to [[Sulfer Shores]] in [[Osuam]].

There's a booth that says "Anything You Want" and a few stalls down is a wizard with "Feat for a Curse." [[Glacialmaw]] inquires about Anything You Want, but the price is suuuper high - your soul in perpetuity. Feat for a Curse is pretty self-explanatory.

One final tent is a costume booth with a master tailor, with full makeup and costumes available. [[Virahck]] wants to appear sexy, so he inquires about "Gay Robinhood," but turns it down after he hears the price of 10 gold. [[Glacialmaw]] slaps down 10 gold for [[Virahck]] to make the transformation.

We make our way towards [[Dreaming of Dirigibles]], seeing two types of Dirigibles on the way - a larger one which is much more ornate than the smaller. The tower is like 200 feet tall. We see a gift shop with a large [[Dreaming of Dirigibles]] sign, with some company reps handing things out to people as they pass by.

[[Dreaming of Dirigibles]] has two ports, one in [[Yi]] and one in [[Orcida]] - it takes quite a bit of infrastructure for port cities. They're expanding to different locations in the future. We could take a ferry to [[Osuam]], but there aren't any dirigibles that head that way so close. It takes about 4 and a half days to get to [[Orcida]] by dirigible. It's 50 gold per direction per person for the dirigible transportation.

[[Dreaming of Dirigibles]] is a joint effort of the [[Church of Abertai]] and the Emperor of [[Orcida]], [[Oilug Gollum]]. They are holding a raffle. The large ship, "Spruce Truce," is the newest model, but the smaller ship is an older model. As part of the festival, they are raffling it off to a lucky winner. You need to provide fuel, but since it's small, you can land it in some open spaces. You can also take a course here to learn how to pilot it. It's called the [[Belligerent Dirigibent]]. The drawing is tomorrow at 3pm.

We start heading back towards the center of the city and see a huge line coming from the [[Prying Pumpkin]]. The business is focused on acquiring rare and long lost goods. You can request an item or family heirloom that has been lost and they'll schedule a consultation. It's a business that people from all over the world come to visit for help. They also have a big store for things people will come and recover.

Next to the teller slot is the [[Glacialmaw]] sign with his signature below it, too. Next to the poster is another wanted poster with a drawing of a red-haired halfling wearing black robes.

[[Glacialmaw]] notices that people in the line appear to recognize him.

The shop itself is pretty small, basically a wall of shelves on the perimeter with tons of tiny little figurines and trinkets. There's an old violin, an array of crossbows. Nothing on the shelves appears to be very valuable.

[[Draxus]] casts a friend spell at the desk attendant and follows him into the back room. The door opens into a low lit hallway with overhead lights. There are two doors on the right and the hallway turns on the other side of [[Draxus]]. As quiet as possible, [[Draxus]] tries to listen behind the doors. He goes into the first room, it's a storage room with shelves. It's somewhat collectables that are more valuable than the other room, but nothing particularly exciting. He then enters the room with the creaking - there are two people sitting in what appears to be the breakroom. They're just chatting with one of them leaning back in their chair, causing the creaking noise.

[[Draxus]] chats with the two of them, assuming the role of a temporary worker. He grabs a drink from the fridge and exits the room without incident. [[Draxus]] starts to turn the corner in the hallway, keeping an eye out for the guy he charmed. There's a staircase that goes up, a staircase that goes down, and another door. [[Draxus]] goes up.

The second floor appears to have the same layout. [[Draxus]] hears footsteps above him coming down the stairs. He quickly enters another room - another store room. This one is filled with different types of orbs. [[Draxus]] throws a rat from his hat at a black basketball orb in the back. He misses with two rats, but then beautifully hits it on the third one. It rolls off the shelf and falls. The orb smashes loudly with black pieces of glass on the floor. The glass slowly liquifies. [[Draxus]] steps out of the door and quickly checks on some more rooms.

Meanwhile, [[Kothvush]] distracts one of the employees in the showroom as three others start heading upstairs to address the commotion. A lizardfolk woman approaches [[Glacialmaw]] and asks if he is Glacialmaw, but he introduces himself as Draxus.

[[Draxus]] enters another room, this one is filled with old bones - animal skulls, full skeletons, posed taxidermied animals, a squirrel, a cow with two heads, etc. Some things definitely appear to be human, dwarf, etc. The next room is not a storage room, but there's an altar in the middle of the room with a casting circle carved into it. There are little bits of brown crust. In the back of the room is a trapdoor that is padlocked shut.

[[Draxus]] continues to make his way up to the third floor while the three employees head up from the first to the second. This floor is a bit more opened up, mostly an open floor plan. It's filled with bookcases and books. There isn't much light up here, but all he can see is the first few bookshelves. The fourth floor is also open, but there are windows so it's brighter. There are cubicles with desks. The one closest to the stairs has a map to an item they are searching for. [[Draxus]] takes the map.

The fifth floor has the same hallway layout as floors 1, 2 and 3. [[Draxus]] continues to hear steps coming up the stairs. The sixth floor is a single hallway that leads to one door at the end. He listens from the other side carefully and hears very faint breathing. He opens the door.

It opens to a huge penthouse office with a large oak desk and a swivel chair. The chair spins around and a man with blond wavy hair petting a cat and says, "You're not supposed to be up here. Employees are not allowed on the sixth floor. Greg? I'm going to have to talk to whoever trained you. You know who I am, right? I am the owner of the [[Prying Pumpkin]]. Please see yourself out." [[Draxus]] sees that the office is looking out over Awful Ave. There's a cage in the corner and Draxus sees that he is missing his pointer finger.

[[Draxus]] heads down to the fifth floor and sees a guard standing at the stairs. They are looking at the desks in the cubicles. They confront him and say that they know he doesn't work here. They attempt to grapple [[Draxus]]. He tears off a large chunk of [[Draxus]]' magic shirt.

[[Draxus]] runs to the second floor to the altar room and another guard meets him at the stairs. [[Draxus]] jukes out the guard and continues to run. He makes it to the altar room and blasts the lock on the trapdoor. The latch cracks and then [[Draxus]] destroys the lock with his axe. There's a dark scary stone staircase, which he goes down and closes the trapdoor behind him. He goes down three floors and it continues to go down. He slows down confused why it's so deep. He's guessing over 7 or 8 floors down. He rounds another set of stairs and it opens to a corridor. It's lit by torch so [[Draxus]] is immediately blinded.

[[Virahck]] shouts out "Oh my god! Is that [[Glacialmaw]] Trundlemain?!" They all start to swarm [[Glacialmaw]] and try to grapple him. [[Kothvush]] uses his Hour of Reaping and frightens most of the people in the room.

[[Draxus]] encounters somebody in the dark room and the weak voice tells him where the torch is in the room - he extinguishes the flame. They are standing in a huge stone room with prison cells on either side of the room. The person talking to [[Draxus]] was propped up against one of the cells. "Run..." he says. [[Draxus]] asks about what is going on here and the man responds, "This is the [[Prying Pumpkin]]..." [[Draxus]] blasts open the cell door of the guy that he was speaking to and he approaches, steps in the cell, and asks for help. The guy looks at [[Draxus]], looks down at his legless body, and [[Draxus]] kills the man. Using the blood of the man, he draws a circle in blood and summons lesser demons.

Two quasit demons appear right by the base of the stairs. The walls at the entrance start to close, trapping [[Draxus]] in this room with the cells.

Meanwhile, 7 people scream and run out of the building but 5 people remain in the building. The [[Prying Pumpkin]] employee I was talking to runs into the back room. One person is able to wrap themselves around [[Glacialmaw]]'s leg and is now grappled.

A group of about 20 city guards surround the entrance of the [[Prying Pumpkin]]. Most everybody is running away from the area and [[Virahck]] safely makes it out, failing to grab a handkerchief.

[[Draxus]], meanwhile, is trapped in what appears to be a jail. Everyone looks horrified. "You absolute cowards!" he yells. He desummons the demons and starts opening cages, letting the inmates out of their cells. They mostly cower in the corner of the cells, but after a few of them, the people start walking out and are uncertain of [[Draxus]]. There are at least 30 people now in this group.

A shorter old man speaks up and tells [[Draxus]] that the [[Prying Pumpkin]] acquires rare and valuable goods. They will attempt to find and recover goods, and even people, from those who have the coin. People have requested *us*, but they have not yet paid the fees. The web of the [[Prying Pumpkin]] spreads far. The [[Guild]] is presumably involved somehow.

[[Draxus]] attempts to fuck around with the door, trying to find a way out. The wall seems to have grown into the doorway, somehow. It appears like there are two blocks of stone that have shifted to the doorway and have expanded, closing the doorway.
