### Session Summary


### Log
**PATH** As we being walking down the path, [[Azurak]] and [[Mo]] suddenly get pulled up by a net (named Annette) and 13 goblins appear. _**COMBAT**_ [[Kothvush]] runs to some goblins but is quickly overwhelmed. [[Mo]] cuts himself and [[Azurak]] out of the net. [[Klept]] swings her short sword and hits herself in the foot. [[Palu]] uses an ice spike and kills a (friendly) bandit and some goblins. After a large ordeal, we kill all the shitters. _**COMBAT OVER**_

**OFF-PATH** We move off the road and into a smaller area off the path. _**LONG REST**_ Nothing happens. _**LONG REST ENDS**_

**BACK ON PATH** We finish our long rest and head onwards down the path.

**CABIN** Fully trashed cabin in the woods. Broken glass everywhere and nothing looks nice. [[Mo]] considers turning into a rat to check out the cabin, but before he makes up his mind, [[Kothvush]] walks right in.

**BASEMENT** The door is unlocked leading down to the basement, it's also pretty trashed. Pieces of broken bottles and torn books. There are **two iron candelabras** in the basement missing candles. [[Azurak]] whispers to [[Kothvush]] to bring some candles. [[Azurak]] casts [[Detect Magic]] and it appears there is magic intertwined with the candelabras. We hand [[Glacialmaw]] the candles and he attempts to put them in place. _**nothing happens...**_ [[Glacialmaw]] tries to rip a candelabra out of the wall but it doesn't budge. [[Kothvush]] lights the candles after [[Mo]] considers forcing the candelabra out of it's position.

**SECRET SECOND BASEMENT** Wooden, glass, and metal trinkets are on the table. There's a putrid smell. There are some gadgets hanging from hooks and there's a big book in the center of the table. There appears to be a map under the journal.

**JOURNAL** Dated entries written in common of places [[Derrick Ifburge]] has visited. He is a spice salesman and has traveled all over the world selling spices. He is also blind. _[[Azurak]] takes the journal._ _**MAP**_ _see below_ _[[Kothvush]] takes the map._
