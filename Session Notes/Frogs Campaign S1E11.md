### Log
**THE DULLARD GULL**
[[The Dullard Gull]]
We wake up and [[Azurak]] is gone! We eat some breakfast from [[Dick Crabbe]], despite [[Azurak]]'s departure. We tell Dick that he's away in boarding school now. We want to ask Rickon about where the wererat may be... Dick presumes that he's back in the [[Eroll Cove Sewers]] or [[The Supple Wench]]. We want to head north by land - probably take 12 days.

**PREPARING FOR TRAVEL** We are gathering supplies for the trip, rations, and maybe some horses to come along with us.

**THE STABLES** Only a couple horses around, along with some stablebois. We have several horses (war, work, stallions, etc.) and some donkeys. We don't rent them out, no. Cheapest is 55 gold for a pony, stallion is gonna be upwards of 100, 150 gold. War horses are 400 or 500, depending on the horse. Phat ass gonna be 25, two available, brothers in fact. Both for 45. [[Palu]] goes in to snag a nice ass. Left is [[Jeff]], right is [[Hess]]. (they fuck each other) Palu offers 40 for the two horny fuckers and the man agrees! [[Virahck]] yells at [[Palu]] for getting 2 donkeys and [[Glacialmaw]] starts talking to them like like dogs. One definitely has a penis, one might have a penis but that also might be a clitoris?? [[Virahck]] asks [[Sir Schwaggus]] to ask the penis donkey what it's name is - "[[Jess]]" And the other one - "[[Heff]]" [[Virahck]] starts talking to [[Jeffree]]. 30lbs of feed for 10 gold - Virahck buys 15lbs. North of here is the desert, so you'll need water. There are hats available for purchase! 15 gold each

**MIGUEL'S** [[Glacialmaw]] asks about getting custom hats done for the donkeys. Could get a yarmulke for 3 silver! Virahck buys a [[Rock of Detect Gravity]] and [[Glacialmaw]] buys 2 yarmulkes. [[Virahck]] buys the umbrella that rains on the inside ([[Inverse Umbrella]]). [[Glacialmaw]] place the hats on [[Jess]] and [[Heff]].

**THE STABLES** Buy some saddlebag.

**OUT OF EROLL COVE** We try and figure out the way to [[Eroglyf]] and start walking until the night is upon us. We find a fallen over tree with some cover from the road, think it's best to set up camp here.

_**LONG REST**_ The road thins and turns to sand as we walk. There is no more visible road. We can follow the footprints in the sand to know where to go. [[Kothvush]] leads us away from the "road" and see some large stones sticking out of the sand...

**SAND OCEAN** [[Virahck]] sees something pop out of the sand... And again... Then [[Kothvush]] sees a shark fin popping out of the sand. [[Glacialmaw]] prepares a harpoon of sorts. A [[sandshark]] bites the javelin and we start a tug of war. [[Virahck]] attacks the shark. [[Glacialmaw]] pulls out the shark himself and it flops onto the ground. 10-12 feet long, scales are pretty snakey rather than fishy. Shark is gone...

_**What to do...**_
