### Log
**THE DULLARD GULL**
[[The Dullard Gull]]
We wake up and [[Mo]] is missing. [[Azurak]] lets the _whores_ sleep in his room while we go out for the day. We still have a bit of drugs left but [[Mo]] definitely took some when he left. We try to find [[Dick Crabbe]], but he's not there. [[Virahck]] writes a note to let Dick know we are going to find his son. We head to the sewers.

**THE SEWERS**
[[Eroll Cove Sewers]]
There is a wide hallway, a wide stream of water, 10ft paths on either side. Water is murky brown and... gross. We close the manhole cover behind us. It smells like ass. We head downstream and hug the left wall. The walls actually look pretty clean.

**DEAD END** As [[Virahck]] rounds the corner, a squirmy boi slinks out of the murky water and tries to bite [[Virahck]]. We continue hugging the left wall but then reach a wall. [[Palu]] uses his [[Wand of Detect Magic]] and... nothing happens. [[Glacialmaw]] drops the rock into the water and water splashes, we hear a plunk after 1 second. We determine the water is about 3 or 4 feet. _Send_ - the boat expands and creates a little pathway across the sewer. [[Palu]] stays on the boat while everyone hugs the other wall and lights a torch. [[Glacialmaw]] ties a rope to the boat and drags it from the hallway. There's something swimming in the water, but it's hard to tell what it is. We put the boat away.

**SEWER ROOM** The water is about 2 feet in this room, there are two grates above us but only one is showering light on us. The dark grate opens and literal shit falls down into the water.

_[[Palu]] falls into the water_ We head onwards. We arrive at another square room and see a wooden bridge.

_A leech attacks!_

_**COMBAT**_ There are even more leeches swimming around and surfacing. [[Kothvush]] gets covered in shitwater and is _restrained_, but then walks out of it. [[Palu]] detaches the leech from his leg. [[Glacialmaw]] explodes a pixie on a leech and does some damage to it. [[Azurak]] goes unconscious. [[Kothvush]] rips off a potion of healing patch and he pours it down [[Azurak]]'s throat. [[Virahck]] splatters the fuck out of a leech. After a long time, we kill them all. _**COMBAT OVER**_

**DEAD END** We use the boat to cross over again. We see a dead body that appears to have been killed by leeches. He looks very pale, he has all his fingers, one hand has 3 gold rings with bloodstones. We find 14 gold in a purse, nothing else, really.

**ANOTHER ROOM** Same old same old...

**ENORMOUS ROOM** With a circular pool. There's a grate in the middle, it's dark. As we walk closer, we see an orange spikey stalagmites sticking out of the water. The spikes start moving out of the water. Multilegged reptilian horror with massive jaws and pointed teeth.
