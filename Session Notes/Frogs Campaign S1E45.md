### Session Summary
[[Palu]]'s lifeless body lies on the ground as the vampire spawn continue to fight the party. Everyone seems to be running out of breath as an unknown sea creature appears next to [[Kothvush]] before attacking the vampire spawn. [[Kothvush]] is caught completely off guard and doesn't know what to say.

Fighting continues and at one point, [[Draxus]] pushes one of the vampire spawn back into the darkness and [[Vevnas]] conjures a ring of water surrounding it. Due to the interaction between the water and the cold of the spell, the wall of water freezes solid, trapping the vampire spawn in the acid fueled terror of [[Draxus]]' spell.

[[Vevnas]] does his best to teleport around the battlefield dealing damage to the spawn but the party is too injured to keep up. [[Glacialmaw]] falls unconscious.

After pushing another one of the vampire spawn through a wall *into* a nearby building, [[Kothvush]] rips off another patch from his [[Robe of Useful Items]] and conjures a door at the broken brick wall, trapping the vampire spawn within. [[Glacialmaw]] twitches as the life begins to leave his unconscious body...

As the darkness from [[Draxus]]' spell dissipates, he sees [[Palu]] on the ground, lifeless as well.

We turn around to see yet another vampire spawn returning to the battlefield, only to be surrounded by four capable city guards who beat him into oblivion. The guards approach the party and are impressed with the damage they've done to the undead infiltrators.

The guards mention to the party that there are probably only one or two vampire spawn left, but with such a small group that came down into [[Yi]], it appears that this may have been a targeted attack with some type of objective in mind... They ask if anything was out of the ordinary, however, [[Kothvush]] blocks their view of the silver bag embroidered with the letters *SW* and continue to chat.

The guards tell us that we've done the city of [[Yi]] a great service and that they wish us to meet with the governor and mayor tomorrow morning to discuss what's happened in the city and to talk about what to do moving forward.

A dragonborn named [[Talus Porridge]] introduces herself as the head of the city guard and tells her subordinate to write down the information of the party.

One of the guards looks at [[Glacialmaw]] and asks if that's really him, saying, "I always knew he was a hero, I never believed what the people at the [[Prying Pumpkin]] said about him. Breaks my heart to see Glacialmaw Trundlemain dead - his poetry and activism were unparalleled. His writing was so thoughtful... I hope the rest of you make it through the night to pass on his memory. Perhaps a statue in his honor..."

The guards walk off heading north back to Central and the party gathers up their dead while [[Kothvush]] makes sure to grab the *SW* bag from the last vampire dust pile.

[[Draxus]] and [[Vevnas]] speak a bit and [[Vevnas]] reveals that he is from a warrior clan based in a deep underwater tribe, destined to keep otherworldly magic away from forces that would seek to ravage the mortal plane. He cautions the party when he hears them speak about [[The Beast]], stating that they are messing with forces that they aren't fully familiar with. He doesn't tell them not to go through with it, but rather, to exercise the utmost caution with moving forward. He also tells the party that he knows [[Kothvush]], but neither of them elaborates too much on that topic, only that [[Kothvush]] has visited the underwater library in the past.

We make the decision to get the fuck out of here and we head towards the [[Hotel D'Lemaer]], making it back inside safely. Once we have laid out our dead in the other room, [[Kothvush]] opens the soft, silky light blue bag with the embroidered letters *SW*. The letters almost appear to be glowing - it's a pale blue light, almost like the moon, that reflects off of the smooth marble surfaces of the hotel. [[Kothvush]] pulls out an octahedron made from dark tanzanite, which [[Virahck]] and [[Vevnas]] appear to recognize.

[[Virahck]] mentions that this was the family heirloom that was sitting on the mantle of the [[Silverweavers]] store and [[Vevnas]] doesn't know too much about the object, only that there is a dark power and great danger associated with it. It may be worth disposing of as there's great chaos in whatever power this item holds. It may be related to [[The Beast]] that the party seeks... But recommends that more research might be warranted at his library.

In death, [[Palu]] feels cold and sickly, deeply regretting her previous wishes for death, feeling like there is so much yet to accomplish - she longs to be resurrected.

In [[Glacialmaw]]'s afterlife, he is met with many friends and strangers asking for stories of his adventuring throughout the world. He seems happy and content as he reminisces with new friends about his time on the mortal plane...

The party, feeling utterly defeated, curls up in the [[Hotel D'Lemaer]] to lick their wounds. [[Vevnas]] takes [[Kothvush]] into the other room at one point and the two of them speak for a while before heading to sleep like the rest of the party...

### Log
[[Palu]] is dead but nobody can see her. The party is hurting and this unknown sea creature has shown up out of the blue and has begun assisting the party in their combat.

[[Kothvush]] looks completely caught off guard by [[Vevnas]]' appearance. The party sees [[Vevnas]] teleporting and swinging his trident around like it's nothing.

After [[Draxus]] pushes the vampire spawn into the darkness and [[Vevnas]] conjures a ring of water around it, and with the cold damage from Hunger of Hadar, the ring of water freezes into a solid frozen wall, trapping one of the vampires in the darkness.

[[Glacialmaw]] fails his death saving throws with a [[Natural 1]] and dies...

[[Kothvush]] conjures on iron door in the space that [[Draxus]] made, trapping one of the vampire spawn in the building.

When one of the vampires dies, it dropped the bag with *SW* written on the side.

[[Draxus]] wants to grab [[Palu]] and we'll meet up at the [[Hotel D'Lemaer]].

Another vampire spawn appears (the one that was running away previously) but several city guards are following him. The four of them surround the vampire spawn and simultaneously swipe at it, killing the creature without it having an opportunity to survive.

One of the dragonborn city guards approaches saying, "Did you kill all 5 of these? Alright, well how many does that leave? At least 20 to start... we've dealt with a number of them... There's probably one or two more. You've done the city of [[Yi]] a great service. It should be safer when the sun rises again."

[[Draxus]] asks if the city guards will escort us to the [[Belligerent Dirigibent]], claiming that we won the contest. The guard furrows her brow, unsure if [[Draxus]] is telling the truth. They recommend waiting as they will be heading north, needing to update the governor and the mayor of the progress in defending the city. They keep questioning us about our familiarity of the vampires. They state that the vampires may have had a goal of damage and destruction. There was a group destroying [[Silverweavers]], perhaps the *SW* from the bag was from there. They say the mayor and governor may want our assistance with cleaning up the city.

[[Talus Porridge]] is the dragonborn guard woman we were speaking to. If you wish for an escort, you may join us. Either way, stay safe until the sun rises. There are probably only two vampires left or so.

One of the guards looks to [[Glacialmaw]]'s body and inquires if that is really him. "I always knew he was a hero, I never believed what the people at the [[Prying Pumpkin]] said about him. Breaks my heart to see Glacialmaw Trundlemain dead - his poetry and activism were unparalleled. His writing was so thoughtful... I hope the rest of you make it through the night to pass on his memory. Perhaps a statue in his honor..."

"Such a shame the cancer got to him." - [[Draxus]]

[[Talus Porridge]], as she is leaving, says that the governor and mayor would very likely want to speak with us tomorrow morning. To mourn and keep track of the number of living people. The guards walk off to the north. [[Kothvush]] grabs the *SW* bag.

We think about what to do... [[Vevnas]] suggests that speaking to the governor and mayor to gather more information and we all head back to the [[Hotel D'Lemaer]] for a long rest.

[[Kothvush]] opens the *SW* bag... It's a soft, silky texture with a light blue color. It glows with a pale blue color like the moon. It reflects off some of the smooth surfaces of the walls. Inside, there is an octahedron made from a dark tanzanite. [[Virahck]] and [[Vevnas]] would recognize this. It was on the mantle of [[Silverweavers]]. The owner of [[Silverweavers]] told us that it was an family heirloom and not for sale.

[[Vevnas]] doesn't know a ton specifically about what it is, but says, "This gemstone has a dark, dark power to this. A great danger is associated with it. It may be worth disposing of it, there's great chaos in whatever power this thing holds. It may be related to [[The Beast]] you seek. We can always go to my library for more research."

[[Palu]] is regretting longing for death. It feels very cold and sickly and, with every fiber of her being, she longs to be resurrected.

[[Glacialmaw]] is being met in the afterlife with many people in death, asking for stories of his adventures and reminiscing of his time on the mortal plane. He seems happy here.
