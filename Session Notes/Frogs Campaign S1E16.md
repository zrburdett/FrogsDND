### Log
_**WE BEGIN TO LEAVE...**_ There are four people waiting for us when we arrive at the entrance of the pyramid. _"Hault! We are from [[Guild]] and you have the artifact that we are looking for."_ We'll let you go on your way if you lead us to the mummies inside. [[Draxus]] tries to make an illusion of light in the stunning coffin and the leader stops in his tracks. [[Palu]] attacks the guild members! _**COMBAT**_ We kill 3 of the lower ranking guild members and then begin to intimidate the last one.

_**INTERROGATION**_ [[Harar Vun]] is the Guild Master that runs the chapter in [[Eroglyf]]. The black stone is a [[Glimpsing Gem]]. [[Guild]] is involved in everything and their purpose is to get power and money. Involved in most islands around here in the northern sea. They're trying to get more involved in the local governments, run trade routes, smuggle illegal and legal goods. They didn't tell him what the stone does. The guild wanted the book to learn about the pyramid. [[Broseph]] sent me. The [[Counsel of Masters]] probably sealed up the other rooms in here when they sealed the pyramid. [[Kothvush]] bashes his skull in. We stuff the bodies into the empty sarcophagi and clean up a bit before leaving the pyramid.

_**WALKING THE PATH**_ We are approached by 3 people wearing hooded cloaks. We are from [[Shadow of the Knife]], an association you may have heard of before. We have been tailing those guild members for some time. We bluff and tell them there were no guild members. They say they saw the guild members and they also saw a bat. _**Did you wake [[Dal Glug]]?**_ _You've made a huge mistake if you woke him. Do you know what a vampire is?_ _The [[Counsel of Masters]] sealed him in the tomb. We consider ourselves [[Guild]]'s primary rival. We definitely don't want a vampire running around our city._ What if we help you with the vampire problem and you give us protection from [[Guild]]? _We can help but [[Guild]] has much more power than us in this city. We suggest you leave here. There are some places safer for us than here - an outpost in the [[Wishbones]] that is protected. It's in [[Ulith Pass]], many of our members reside here. Did you find the [[Glimpsing Gem]]? We're not interested in the counsel or the politics in [[Tapu Ero]]. We have an aversion to vampires and know what vampires seek - blood and power. If a vampire takes over [[Tapu Ero]], it will seek power elsewhere, too, building an army of vampire spawn, killing everybody._ _In exchange for protection, we would like to use the artifact._ _The [[Glimpsing Gem]] is priceless - there's only one in existence. If you hold the gem, you will see a vision of the future._ _If you put a stake in a vampires heart at their resting place, it will paralyze them._ _We were going to send a messenger to the outpost but you could accompany them._ One of the quiet hooded people look at [[Palu]] and says _"What is that wound on your neck?"_ [[Palu]] sees under the hood and sees a gaunt face and pale skin with pointed teeth. _Something is going to happen to you. I recognize this. Let's just say... you'll have a certain association with the [[Shadow of the Knife]] in a few weeks time._ _All the members of the [[Shadow of the Knife]] have been victims of vampires, one way or another._

_It's a horrible existence. If we had the capabilities to wish it away, we would. It's a disease - death itself._ _I will be the messenger and your guide. We will leave early - before the sun rises. You can stay in our guild hall until then._ _[[Guild]] does not respect our organization, but they do not kill us so openly._ The woman who will be our guide is [[Ebu Tart]].

_**WHAT'S THE PLAN?**_ We can still try and sell the book to the guild. Sell the book at the bookstore. Give the book to the library.

**LIBRARY** We inquire about a reward for giving a missing book to the library. We tell him about our [[Tapu Ero]] [[All the Many Histories of Tapu Ero|book]]. _This has been missing for several months! Where did you find it?_ Who, by rights, owns this book? _The book was stolen from the library, but I could provide some reward. The library does not have much power here._ [[Glacialmaw]] pushes over a stack of books and causes a scene. The librarian kicks us out of the library. A scholar quickly sketches us and puts us on the banned list. There are now many many guards around the city looking for [[Glacialmaw]].

**SHADOW OF THE KNIFE GUILD HALL** While [[Virahck]] picks up rations and [[Heff]] from the stables, we lay low in the guild hall. They give us some background and a map of the [[Wishbones]]. Be wary of [[Sorflow]]. [[Guild]] has a place there and it is rather populated. Keep a low profile - giants, trolls, hearty beasts. They didn't get rid of all the giants. Very difficult terrain. There's a giant village in the southern area. The people who gave us the map didn't realize the red x was there. The outpost is at [[Ulith Pass]].

_**GONE IN THE NIGHT**_ We leave the city and nothing stops us. Headed towards the canal. It takes us two days to get to the canal and one more to get out to sea. We make out way to the [[Wishbones]]. [[Trenmere Village]] likely used to be populated with giants. [[Parid Glenn]] is a bigger city - it's mid sized. [[Sorflow]] and [[Osplett's Gate]] are the largest cities. It is best to head to the river that goes through [[Sorflow]] to get to [[Ulith Pass]].

_**SHIP IN THE DISTANCE**_ It's bigger than our ship - and it's waving a pirate's flag. We try to get around them but we are stuck. There are a bunch of pirates on the ship. They begin throwing ropes over to us to attach. [[Palu]] attempts to burn the ropes and their boat. One pirate jumps over - but gets immediately pushed into the water by [[Glacialmaw]]. [[Palu]] casts sleep and the captain slumps over the wheel, turning the boat in an awkward position. [[Draxus]] jumps over and starts fucken 'em up. [[Kothvush]] follows.

_**COMBAT**_ We _fuck_ them up and commandeer their boat.
