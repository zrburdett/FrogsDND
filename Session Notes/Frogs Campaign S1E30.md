### Last time


### Session Summary
The party, after just having made it out of the [[Feywild]], attempts to head back to the dinghy so they can return to [[Lightning McQueen]], but notice that the dinghy is gone! We can still see [[Lightning McQueen]] in the distance, but it's rather far away so we need to figure out a way to get over there safely.

[[Kothvush]], being a strong swimmer who can breathe underwater, climbs down a bit then jumps off the cliff and starts swimming over. [[Virahck]] flies over with the help of [[Palu]]'s [[Fly]] spell. Eventually, the boat is moved and the rest of the party makes it back, realizing that the block of ice that was previously encasing this [[Tikamor|woman]] has melted, and she is passed out on the deck of the boat, skin still cold as can be.

[[Glacialmaw]] cures her wounds but notices that there's an aspect of magic about her... We're not sure what to do as she won't even wake up when [[Virahck]] slaps her across the face, so we decide to head over to [[Tapu Ero]] in an attempt to find the gather supplies and regroup with our lost friends in [[Shadow of the Knife]].

As we begin to transition into sleep, however, we find ourselves in an unfamiliar place - the beach of a small island about 200 feet across. Confused, we wander around and experience something peculiar... Despite the blaring sun ahead or the sand in our toes, our completely naked bodies can't seem to feel anything. There is an absence to the warmth of the sun, the wetness of the ocean, and the texture of the sand. [[Palu]] is able to cast spells but can't feel the magic leaving her body in the same way that it did before.

Eventually, we come across a small cave housing two people - a man named [[Pico]] and a woman named [[Tikamor]], who we recognize as the woman from the ice. Pico seems eager to see friendly faces, but Tikamor doesn't speak to us at all.

[[Pico]] tells us that we have arrived in the [[Mystic Isle]], but if we want to learn more information, we must beat him in his favorite game - [[Liar's Dice]].

[[Palu]] decides to play along but once it becomes time to reveal the true winner, Palu secretly changes his dice roll to rig the game, ending in [[Pico]]'s first ever loss of his favorite game. Eventually, [[Pico]] tells us more about the island and his background. We learn that this is [[Tikamor]]'s island and [[Pico]] has been hiding here ever since he was captured and thrown in the brig of some military ship many years ago.

[[Pico]] also tells us that [[Tikamor]] can bring us all sorts of things, but we can only make one request per day. It also appears that any attempts to touch one another are fruitless - the coconuts that [[Draxus]] and [[Glacialmaw]] threw at [[Pico]] just seem to pass right though him.

### Log
#### _**HEADING TOWARDS THE SHIP**_
[[Kothvush]] jumps into the water, [[Virahck]] flies over. The [[Tikamor|woman from the ice]] is no longer in the ice. [[Virahck]] tries to wake her with a slap. Her skin is really cold still. Virahck drags her into the shade. We all (eventually) get there.

[[Glacialmaw]] cures her wounds. There's something magical about this, keeping her this way. We begin traveling to [[Tapu Ero]], taking a break so [[Virahck]] can rest. Glacialmaw transitions into sleep, but it's a little different this time... He can taste sand in his mouth, and is on a beach with everyone in the party except [[Urgon Walfa|Urgon]]. No clouds in the sky, sun is blaring overheard, but doesn't feel very warm. We notice that the water doesn't have a temperature or even feel wet. None of us have equipment or clothes. [[Palu]] attempts to cast a spell, but it doesn't feel like it's even happening. She hears it echo around the island. We can see across the whole island, maybe 200 ft long, there's a hill in the middle with a few trees. [[Draxus]] runs into the water and attempts to swim. He can do so, doggie paddling. He can't really feel the water, but the temperature or wetness doesn't transfer to his body.

#### _**THE HILL**_
[[Glacialmaw]] attempts to walk up the hill, but can't really ever reach the top. [[Draxus]] walks around the whole coast of the island. He sees the mouth of a cave in the stone hill. Draxus shouts for us and then enters the cave. He sees a source of light and continues before reaching a beautiful rug on the floor, a large armchair, and a four poster bed. There is a man and a woman. They are both missing their teeth. "Did you just arrive here? Well, welcome! This is the [[Mystic Isle]]. You have washed up upon the shores just as I did many years ago." There's artwork on the walls and everything, crates with bottles of wine, blocks of cheese. "Lots of interesting things wash up on these shores. I appeared here naked just as you did." He has white linen clothes on. He offers us all a glass of mead. "We are somewhere within the northern sea, but I don't really remember... I was on a ship before... I could answer more questions, but you must offer something to me." "If you can beat me at my favorite game, I'll answer any of your questions. I haven't introduced you to [[Tikamor]] - she was here on this island when I washed up here." Her skin looks the same cold and clammy that it did as on the boat.

#### _**THE GAME**_
[[Pico]] reaches into a crate, pulling out chips and pico. "[[Liar's Dice]]. I will only play with one person at a time. Both of us will roll 5d6. The number you get is your number of points. Each turn..." ...something something squid game game. [[Palu]] attempts to lie to [[Pico]]. [[Palu]] gotta change 3 dice secretly. Pico furrows his brow and considers calling out [[Palu]], but accepts his first defeat _ever_. Palu intimidates [[Pico]] for info, he laughs and says that this is [[Tikamor]]'s island. I'm hiding here. I was in the brig of a military ship, but when I awoke, I washed up on this island. I thought I was dead. There's a window to see where you are in the real world. You can request something from [[Tikamor]] once each day and she will have it washed up on shore. [[Draxus]] and [[Glacialmaw]] decide to throw coconuts at [[Pico]]. It should strike him right on the face, but it passes through him and hits the wall. "You can't hurt me here on the [[Mystic Isle]]. None of us can!" [[Draxus]] requests a vial of blood. There's a small square cutout in the corner of the sky, no vial or blood.
