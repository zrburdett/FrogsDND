### Log
_**SHORT REST**_

We hear some fluttering around the cave, nothing much else. This pool is rather isolated and stagnant. Gradually getting deeper as you go in, but not as deep as the first one. [[Virahck]] grabs some of the weapons from the corpses. We decide to head to the left section of the [[Crockpot Cave|cave]].

_**SLEEPING AREA**_ Sleeping quarters with a bunch of beds. We take some of the bed rolls to replace the ones that were previously burnt up.

_**BOTTOM ROOM**_ Nothing much in here... _EXCEPT BATS!_ We kill 30 bats then put some of their bat corpses in the bat bucket.

_**CAVE TUNNEL**_ There's another body of water and a carnivorous [[Mammoth]]. The lil bitch runs away.
 
_**SMALL CHAMBER**_ ...where the mammoth ran to. Tapestries, double bed, two people meditating. Mountain dwarf (woman) and a wood elf. Mountain dwarf has the same gray, flaky skin. They awaken and ask how they made it back here. [[Draxus]] places the bucket of dead bats at the feet of the two. [[Draxus]] points out the affliction, and she asks how to cure it. It all started when my sister [[Tulsi]] gave me these goods that she stole from a shop in [[Logor]] - one of the items must have been cursed. She points to the trunk where the items are stored. [[Draxus]] tries to reason with the [[Mammoth]] to transport us across, but he gets fucking trampled. [[Kothvush]] tries and it works, until the [[Mammoth]] gets a glimpse of [[Draxus]] before he charges.

_**TRUNK**_ Wooden scroll case with intricate carvings Jade statuette, small, head sized, of a giant Large metal quiver Set of silver rings Golden crown with inlaid onyx and platinum 2 glass vials with a blue sparkling glow

[[Glacialmaw]] notices that the crown has writing on the inner rim, written in Giant:
>[!quote] Golden crown with inlaid onyx inscription
>Home Beneath Our Mother
>North and around Three
>Find our mirror image
>beneath the Oharah Tree

The writing is filled with onyx.

The [[Ohara Tree]] might be on the [[Wishbones]] somewhere. One of the bottles is cracked.

Everything except the rings and quiver glow when [[Detect Magic|detect magic]] is cast.

Slow rolling hills on the way to [[The Fields]] We see a lot of debris on the ground as we walk. Stone -rich black and polished, but well worn They used an insane amount of black stone when building [[Macknus]] - over 3 billion stones were purchased, dug from [[Ulith Pass]]. This area has been MASSIVELY desecrated by magic. Something similar of what happened to [[Dal Glug]] happened at the Wishbones too - destruction and genocide. Perhaps [[The Fields]] is where [[Macknus]] used to be?

200 foot tall statue - head and much of the torso is exposed with legs on the other side of the earth that covers it - [[Bloam the Builder]], from [[Macknus]]

More chunks of black stone are revealed under the dirt, and some bone...

[[Glacialmaw]] puts the crown on. With [[Palu]]'s help, [[Virahck]] flies into the air and looks around to see an enormous tree, maybe 15 miles away. There's a large circular structure surrounding the tree - it looks like colosseum but biiig. Structure is the same black stone with golden trim. Carved into the stone around each arch: "OHARA" The building is in rather good shape, but the vegetation is overgrown Thique veggie you gotta push through. On the inside of the leaves, light can barely reach in. The trunk of the tree is extremely thick (60ft ish) trunk is pale, milky white and the leaves are similar to afflicted's skin. The tree is alive and magical. The mirror's frame is the same milky white as the tree trunk. [[Draxus]] seems the same reflection and sees at the base of the tree a dark mist in the mirror image - he walks over. There's a small opening near the roots that looks like you can get into. Now the dark mist is realllll - and it's blinding. As [[Draxus]] walks forward, he finds himself back in the same area, but the color of the tree is different... The tree is entirely different. Leaves are gone and things are stripped. The tree looks dead, almost black. The colosseum is still there, but the shrubbery is dead and instead of mounds around the building, there are buildings with the shiny stone. Sky is dark gray, frightening. Light is faded and thin. All the seats of the colosseum are filled with humanoid figures - almost like they're made of shadow, they erupt with noise as they stare at him.

There is heavy footsteps near [[Draxus]] - a ghostly giant approaches. 50 feet tall. [[Draxus]] speaks to the giant, who growls back in a language [[Draxus]] does not understand. The giant looks sad - almost see a flicker of tears. [[Glacialmaw]] puts the crown on and steps into the roots, with the same thing happening. [[Glacialmaw]] takes off the crown and waves to the giant. When the giant sees the crown, his eyes darken as he demands the return of the crown. [[Glacialmaw]] asks about the crown. The giant responds with "It belongs to me." The giant takes the crown, but it is actually a ring. The giant walks over to the roots where they exited, and reaches his arm into the roots, then says he returned the ring to himself. He turns away and fades before vanishing.

[[Draxus]] goes back through the hole, but the mist is not there. Instead, there is more of an opening in the tunnel rather than the mist. [[Draxus]] walks for 10 minutes into the tree. It opens to a room made of roots. He sees a small dwarf lying unconscious, with thin and gray skin. [[Draxus]] rolls him over to see facial piercings. He asks "What happened in [[The Fields|the fields]]?" He lifts a quivering hand pointing to the back of the room. Cut out of the roots is a face in the wall - 10 feet tall and extremely thin can see all the bones. He has one eye and the other one has a root growing out of it, wrapping around his neck.

[[Draxus]] summons his axe and the face reacts, opening its eyes, asking "Do you know what happened in [[The Fields|the fields]]?" "Well you cannot free me from the [[Ohara Tree]] - do not attempt to. I became one with the tree 200 years ago. I was once the king of [[Macknus]], 312th king in a long line of glory. We lived in wealth in comfort and peace. Nobody could challenge our might. The [[Wishbones]] were safe, free, and welcoming. I failed to realize the dangers between elves, humans, and dwarfs. My closest advisor - I wish I could see him now. He begged me to release the beast of our ancestors - [[Briar]] did. We had an army, but the giants were not ready for force after peace for years. The city was destroyed. After the slaughter, the coalition pulled the earth, sinking our city. They came for me next, until I saw the mirror. That was the last time I saw the true [[Macknus]] - not this false version that is left in the mirror. They cannot stand before the tree while I am here. I hope for death but [[Ohara Tree|Ohara]] keeps me sealed here." He starts to cry.

"Where do these colonies of giants live? There has always been a small group of giants living on the [[Lonely Peak]]. Nothing could convince them to join us in [[Macknus]]. What happened to the orcs? The coalition?" [[Glacialmaw]] tells him of [[Dal Glug]]. "We met several times before his passing. I didn't know he was a vampire - they are dangerous. [[Dal Glug]] was strong and charismatic - I would be very concerned now that he's been awakened. That dwarf came here a short while ago and spoke kindly to me, but he stole my possessions. I expect he meant no harm but harm has come to him for his choice. Without the treasures, I cannot change his fate. The curse now should be lifted. The ring was the important item. On the note of releasing me, it is impossible. I'm sealed here forever. I knew I couldn't die without opening a connection between worlds. I don't think the city can be returned to it's true self. The land has been destroyed, ghosts haunt this land. My name is _**[[King Fleshbarg|KING FLESHBARG]]**_. Before you leave..." He hands [[Draxus]] a [[King Fleshbarg's Key|small onyx cube]], saying "This key is meaningless to me now. Hearing what you said about [[Dal Glug]], perhaps you will need [[The Beast]] my ancestors sealed. My closest advisor urged me to release it, but I was too slow and indecisive. The giant's required help, but some disasters can only be solved by creating new ones. If you use this key, and the 5 others, you may be able to open what we sealed. It's difficult to control. When we sealed it, we needed help across the world to seal it in the first place."

"I do not decipher prophecies or dreams, but it seems you have an important role to play. I do not know of a mushroom like that, but many types of mushrooms grow in the [[Towering Forest]], perhaps it is there?"

[[Draxus]] and [[Glacialmaw]] return to the real world.
