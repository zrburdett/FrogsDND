### Session Summary
As we take our leave from [[Scaramar]], [[Dain Nashula]] tells us that the [[Fortnight of Yidi]] is ongoing and it's probably worth going to find out more information about the [[Andees]]. [[Ebu Tart]] is likely no longer interested in traveling with us in the future, but [[Urgon Walfa]] would like to be picked up when we inevitably leave the [[Andees]].

As we sail towards the capital city of [[Yi]], we see an abundance of ships and activity due to the festival, even noticing a tower with one of those airships we've previously seen on the way to the [[Andees]].

We speak to the ferrywoman in the [[Yi]] harbor, and even though she lowers the price since we're with the great poet [[Glacialmaw]], we ultimately decide that the price to park is too high, so we make our way north to park for free. Before we leave, however, [[Tikamor]] gets tired of our shit so she jumps off the boat and swims to the shores of [[Yi]].

After hiding our dinghy in the bushes, we make our way south through the industrial district, noticing a warehouse with a flying fish leaping out of a blue barreling wave, exactly the same as the flag on the ship we passed by the docks of [[Scaramar]].

Now passing through the residential section on the outskirts of the city, we meet [[Piemat]] at the information kiosk, who gives us some background on the [[Fortnight of Yidi]] and some of the activities we can get involved with while the festival is ongoing for the next eight days.

We learn that [[Dreaming of Dirigibles]] provides air travel to [[Orcida]], which will help with our search for the [[Orc's Key]].

We make our way to the [[Church of Abertai]] and [[Virahck]] gets himself put on a watchlist after we learn more information on [[Yuri Dimitri]]'s second in command, [[Abertai]], who was more involved in the devious and strategic methods of fighting back in his day. Somewhere over 80% of all people in the [[Andees]] belong to the [[Church of Abertai]] in some way shape or form. We are told there isn't much of a history of vampires in the [[Andees]], but we may be able to get more information from the church's high priest, [[Gnol Pollom]].

[[Glacialmaw]] makes his way to the [[Prying Pumpkin]] and notices a "wanted" poster of himself on the wall. A crowd gathers as he signs the poster then heads to the Circle for the mayor's speech.

The mayor, [[Joan McAlleter]], gives us a bit of history of the [[Andees]], and she provides everyone at the [[Fortnight of Yidi]] currently a [[Writtle Fruit]] of their own, as is tradition to consume one each day for the festival.

As the mayor's speech ends, [[Draxus]] meets some people, who end up inviting him for drinks later at the [[Wandering Water Witch]] and [[Piemat]] ends up finding us at the Circle, wanting the swimming lessons we promised her earlier.

### Log
After 30 minutes, [[Draxus]] finally is able to take another bite of the red fruit - he likes it even more this time. [[Ebu Tart]] left right away but [[Urgon Walfa]] stuck around for a bit before telling us that he will be staying behind for a bit, willing to leave the [[Andees]] when we do.

We walk for a bit and finally make it back to the dock. [[Dain Nashula]] tells us that the festival is ongoing in [[Yi]]. We decide to go to [[Yi]] by sailing southeast around the island under the [[Di]] / [[Do]] Bridge - it's fuckin massive like 2 miles long and we are in awe of this massive structural feat. The cities look very similar, with small boxy houses and a beautiful array of pastel multicolored houses, many boats docked along the shoreline. We continue sailing and finally make it to the harbor of [[Yi]].

When we pass the mouth of the river, we see a tall tower with one of those airships "parked" at the top.

It's chaotic here. Lots of boats in the water, tons of dinghies traveling to and from boats. We get the ferry's attention and we speak to them. The rate for parking here is 300 gold, with no time limit. Somehow, the ferry master recognizes [[Glacialmaw]] from his poetry - she knocks 50 gold off the price. The price is wayy to steep for us to afford so we reverse out of there and try to figure something else out. [[Tikamor]] jumps off the boat and starts swimming towards the city.

We sail north and try to figure something else out. We see some other boats of people that had a similar idea so we drop dinghy and make our way to the land. We hide the dinghy behind a bush and start making our way to the city.

We pass by some fields, stone walls, and a variety of buildings in the city. It's about 5pm now. We continue towards the city. As we make it into the city, we pass by a number of warehouses and boxy buildings, mostly an industrial area. [[Draxus]] notices a warehouse with a painted symbol of a flying fish leaping out of a blue barreling wave. We recognize it as the boat that was leaving [[Scaramar]], who allegedly exchanged blood for fruit. We peek around the area, but don't see much other than a few docks behind the warehouses. [[Draxus]] checks the door - it's locked.

We continue walking down the road and come to a junction - right leads to the circle of the stone brick wall with a gated guard post, left leads south. We continue south and reach another road - looks a lot more residential with a lot more people on the street. We even see a little booth with an 'i' in a circle. A young dwarf blonde woman approaches us, "Can I help you? Are you here for the festival? The [[Fortnight of Yidi]]! It's tradition to consume one red fruit per day during the festival. The [[Authority]] has produced this map - here you go! I live with my grandparents in [[Eiff]], but I live here during the festival. There's plenty of activities here, most during the day but there's some stuff going on at night. There's a short speech by the mayor on The Circle in an hour. Check out the [[Church of Abertai]] too."

[[Dreaming of Dirigibles]] provides trips to [[Orcida]]. The Governor works in Central. We make plans with [[Piemat]] later at the mayor's speech to teach her how to swim.

[[Fortnight of Yidi]] started 6 days ago and is a total of 14 days. Prices for fruit range from 2 to 5 silver and the streets are packed with people.

We head over to the [[Church of Abertai]] - this thing is a huge cathedral with a domed roof at the top with pointed towers on either corner and is made of stone and stained glass. The Circle is a giant circle made of red bricks with a winged woman statue holding a red fruit, with water spraying out of her eyes and down her face, into a fountain. There are three sets of huge double doors going into the church - we walk in.

Right behind the doors, we see a large amphitheater going down into the ground, it circles around a stage of sorts. There's a ring of candles around the stone platform. In the back, there's a pair of double doors with robed people standing outside of them - them seem to be the only officials around. "Welcome to the [[Church of Abertai]]. Those who constructed the church and worship here are the followers. She was the second in command of [[Yuri Dimitri]], famous for command in battle. [[Abertai]] was more interested in more strategic and devious methods of fighting. Liked to take enemies unaware. Because of the many years of history and rumors, there was a certain group of people that saw her as an image of strength - more of a saint than a god, but some consider her godly. The church is a popular organization on the [[Andees]], somewhere over 80% of the people that live here are Aberthane(?)."

"No, there haven't been any vampire attacks or anything here lately... We've heard the rumors of what's going on in [[Tapu Ero]], but the high priest doesn't seem too worried about things. [[Yidi]] is famously a save city. As far as I know, there isn't much of a history of vampires down in the islands. I am a scribe for some of the religious texts here. I've been translating some works about [[Abertai]] recently. Half-dwarf [[Gnol Pollom]] is the high priest here."

[[Glacialmaw]] makes his way to the [[Prying Pumpkin]]. N Main St is rather busy as well with booths on either side of the roadway. He passes the very fancy [[Hotel D'Lemaer]] - a brilliant golden glow emanates from the inside. There's fireplaces around and everyone is very fancy. He walks by the [[Circus of the Mind Arcade]] splintered old wooden "tent" with a slight lean, but it's only from age rather than poor construction. A man coaxes people in with fun, games, discounts, etc.

Awful Ave streets are narrow with two loong gutters splatted with old food, shit, piss, garbage, etc.

[[Prying Pumpkin]] is a large stone tower, first three floors are windowless but the upper ones do indeed have windows. There's a line going out from the building. There's a slot and grate with people yelling into the gate. There's a laughing jack-o-lantern sign above the slot. It appears to have a menu too. Just to the side, there's a huge poster of an ice troll looking for information on [[Glacialmaw]] Trundlemain. "You can't cut the line!" Something splatters the backside of his head. [[Glacialmaw]] goes to sign the poster and a crowd has started to gather to watch.

A gnome woman climbs up on the stage next to the fountain. She has a booming voice that just has to be magical with how well it's projected. "Welcome to another night of the [[Fortnight of Yidi]] and welcome to all the new visitors. We are looking forward to another eight days of fun. I wish everybody the best! Just as I did last night and the night before, I will walk you through some history of the [[Andees]]. [[Yuri Dimitri]] claimed [[Yidi]] as his own and sent his army to [[Lyniys]], crossing the channel where [[The Twins]] now reside. [[Opul]] now is home to the Sleepless University. Let us all thank Yuri with a bite of the red fruit -  if you don't have one, I've done the honor of purchasing a number of fruit for you all!" Kothvush pockets the fruit instead of eating. The fruit at the stalls are a bit small than the ones on [[Scaramar]]. Everybody takes a bite, including the mayor, and she says, "I'm looking forward to the elections following the fortnight and would request a vote for me - my name is [[Joan McAlleter]]. Enjoy the celebrations!"

[[Draxus]] talks to some people and they invite him to sit with them at the [[Wandering Water Witch]] for drinks later on.

[[Piemat]] finds the group and we talk about [[Glacialmaw]]'s wanted poster.
