### Session Summary
Still stuck in [[Mystic Isle]], we attempt several things to get out of the mysterious island, including using [[Palu]]'s [[Fly]] spell, [[Draxus]]' [[Thunder Step]] spell, and [[Glacialmaw]]'s [[Remove Curse]] scroll that [[Tikamor]] was able to bring him. [[Draxus]] even encounters his patron, the [[Demogorgon]], who laughs at him for having friends then promptly ejects him from [[Mystic Isle]]. After falling asleep, however, [[Draxus]] finds himself washing back up on shore, naked with the rest of us.

We eventually decide to have [[Tikamor]] bring us one of those movable staircases like they have in libraries and [[Home Depot]] so we all climb up and head out of [[Mystic Isle]], leaving [[Pico]] and [[Tikamor]] behind.

We continue on our journey south from [[Wishbones]] towards [[Eroll Cove]], seeing the massive [[Iwo Jima]] volcano far off in the distance. [[Virahck]] helps some of the party get some sailing experience under their belt, but night comes quick and most of the party has to get some rest.

As expected, one by one we find ourselves back in [[Mystic Isle]] as we drift off to sleep. Unsure of what to do, we play some games with [[Pico]] before deciding that we need to get him out of this dreamscape that [[Tikamor]] created.

We eventually convince [[Pico]] to take a look at the world he left behind - we slowly climb to the top of the hill and he peers into the rift, seeing a dark room with a shadowy figure sitting in what appears to be a dark and damp prison. He thinks they must have moved him onto land as he can only remember being on a boat.

We attempt go get [[Pico]] to go back through the portal. [[Kothvush]] tries to remind him of his favorite food, which sparks a memory

After a while, [[Glacialmaw]] casts [[Command]] and forces [[Pico]] to go up the stairs and back into reality, despite his previous fears of coming back to a reality in which he didn't want to live. When Glacialmaw gives the news to [[Tikamor]], she immediately follows him and the rest of the party through the rift, bringing us all back to the real world.

[[Tikamor]] explains that she doesn't remember much about her past, only that when people inhabit the island within her mind, she cannot speak and is trapped until everybody else leaves the island. She had been stuck in her own mind for years and years, waiting for [[Pico]] to finally leave [[Mystic Isle]].

We eventually continue on our ways and set course for [[Eroll Cove]].

### Log
#### DREAMWORLD
250 ft circular island, cave, small hill - the cave is where we met the two, woman was the one from the boat, dude is the guy that brought stuff here
They were both on a prison ship at one point and that's how he entered her mind.
How did she get frozen?
[[Glacialmaw]] requests a [[Remove Curse]] scroll from Tikamor, she laps the island and brings Glacialmaw the scroll.
We consider what to do with the scroll.
Draxus attempts to cast the spell from the scroll, but cannot touch Tikamor. Draxus attempts to touch himself and ask the [[Demogorgon]] for help.
Draxus casts the spell but doesn't leave the island.
A rift in space appears and a shadowy dark figure steps through the rift. It towers over Draxus. Even without a clear face, it scowls at Draxus and seems angry that he requested it. Draxus asks for us to be removed from this place.
After a while, the shape of the [[Demogorgon]] starts to become more evident with two dog heads and tentacles. Draxus pleads to the Demogorgon. It laughs at Draxus, "Friends? You want your friends?"
He drags Draxus to the top of the hill with his barbed tentacles, digging into his skin. He lifts Draxus up and pushes him through the circular opening that's floating in the air. Suddenly, Draxus opens his eyes and wakes up on the boat. He then falls asleep.
It seems like we've been here for a while, but the amount of sunlight has not changed at all. ([[Virahck]] had witnessed the Demogorgon drag Draxus to the exit.) [[Palu]] gets up to the top first and sees himself through the window. Palu tries to get Glacialmaw to fly, but he can't touch him. When Draxus went back to sleep, he gets transported back into the dream. Draxus does a blunder and thunder steps, but nobody gets hurt.
Draxus wins [[Pico]]'s dice in a game of [[Liar's Dice]]!
When Draxus passes through the hole, and he wakes up but the dice are gone.
He tries to wake people in the real world by blastin' (nobody wakes up).
Draxus looks through the woman's pockets but finds nothing.
One time, [[Pico]] asked [[Tikamor]] to bring his (dead) mother, but it didn't work.
We all get up and wake up. Tikamor is still unconscious.

#### REAL WORLD
We see a huge mountain with a flattened peak a ways away. It almost looks like a volcano, maybe [[Iwo Jima]].
[[Virahck]] attempts to teach some of the rest of the party how to sail.
It's getting dark now and it's probably about time to sleep.

#### TIKAMORS DREAM WORLD AGAIN
We want to help [[Tikamor]], but [[Pico]] would be transported back to his prison.
We stroll out of the cave and Pico seems very resistant to going up the hill.
Pico takes a look at the top of the hill and looks through the rift seeing...
The outline of a figure, hard to tell the surrounding details. 
It looks different than the brig he used to be in, maybe in a prison on land.
[[Glacialmaw]] casts [[Command]] on [[Pico]], pointing up the stairs saying "Leave."
Pico walks up the stairs and goes through the rift and is gone.
[[Glacialmaw]] asks if [[Tikamor]] would like to come with us after telling her that [[Pico]] left.
Tikamor jumps to her feet, eyebrows wide, and follows Glacialmaw.
We all begin to exit and Tikamor leaves last.
She is awake in the real world!
Tikamor coughs and tries to speak "Finally..."
We scrounge up some food and drink for her.
"You have no idea how long I've been with that fucking guy. Do you know how many times I've played [[Liar's Dice]]?? He's been holding me hostage - I can't leave until everyone else leaves. I'm not sure why this happens to me, I don't have many memories left... I was on that island for a lot longer than I've been here. I was alone on the island for a while... Nobody ever stayed for very long, but [[Pico]] was there for like 1500+ days after he stopped counting a year ago. This is the first time that I've ever escaped the island, from what I remember. Some idiot requested a seed and waited for a tree to grow tall enough to exit. When Pico washed up, the whole military crew washed up too, but they could never convince him to leave."
We continue sailing and we arrive at [[Eroll Cove]].
