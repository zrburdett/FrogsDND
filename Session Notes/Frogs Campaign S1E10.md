### Last time


### Session Summary


### Log
_"I found this dead body, reanimated it, and turned it into a wererat."_ _"He's average hotness."_ _"If you get bitten by a wererat, there's a chance you'll turn too."_ _"Un-Silvered weapons don't have much of an effect on [[wererats]]."_ _"Maybe tie it up, magic that shit? I don't care as long as it's alive."_ _"The [[Basilisk]] is a pet of mine. They have an affinity to certain songs - I have a song that I play on my flute to put it to sleep."_ _"I like it and I don't want to see it killed - you can call it Barry. I only really call it the [[Basilisk]]. There are many people trying to find me - [[Marshall Matters]], for one, head of the city guard."_ _"My behavior is not so popular among common folk. Plus I don't pay taxes."_ _"We launder a lot of money through [[The Dullard Gull]]."_

_"I'm an expert on dying beasts and I'm also an alchemist."_ _"I've invented an especially potent healing potion."_ _"I'm looking to cure wereratism - maybe similar ailments beyond that, too: werewolves, werebears, etc."_ _"You can come see me at [[The Dullard Gull]] when you've found it."_ _"I have a silver shortsword that I can give to you."_ _"You can also see the blacksmith to apply a silver coating"_

We are all given 40 gold each.

We exit the sewers without issue.

**THE DULLARD GULL**
[[The Dullard Gull]]
[[Rickon]] is put to work immediately when we reach the Gull. Palu asks [[Dick Crabbe]] about the reward. Dick is grateful but explains that [[Azurak]] didn't make it to tonight's performance. Dick gives 55 gold to us. Bedtime... _**LONG REST**_

**BLACKSMITH** [[Glacialmaw]] asks to get their pike silvered. Virahck asks about a mace repair or perhaps turned into a flail. Flail costs 20gp, new morningstar would be 40-45gp. The blacksmith is a 7.5/10 by the way. He can do 28, after looking [[Virahck]] up and down. 30gp for a dagger to get silvered. 5 darts at 5gp each, minus 5gp for a total of 20gp

**SAILING SCHOOL** [[Virahck]] brandishes his new morningstar and asks about sailing rates. Virahck threatens to destroy the Sailing School. _"Get the fuck out of my school!"_ He draws a sword. Virahck begins to exit.

**THE DULLARD GULL**
[[The Dullard Gull]]
[[Virahck]] explains that he got kicked out of class and about his "incredible" display of aggression. [[Azurak]] plays a decent show. [[Dick Crabbe]] gives [[Azurak]] 18 gold. We drink and eat and retire to our rooms.

**SEWERS**
[[Eroll Cove Sewers]]
We return to the sewers back in the way that we went in last time. There is writing on the wall that says: _"Move through quickly and you will see what is waiting within me."_ [[Glacialmaw]] runs into the wall and takes 6pts of damage. We hear giggling and the wall becomes translucent. There's a chest on the other side of the wall. 32 gold and a silver dagger and a stone with the number 5 written on it, the size of a human's palm [[Azurak]] takes the dagger. We hear a metallic clanking sound and then a rush of water - the water rises slightly and everyone on the edge gets their feet wet. We see a large iron door that's open - we walk through. We notice stone numbers on the walls - 4 and 7. There's a mechanical click behind the numbers, and it looks like something would fit in the numbers. There's a ladder. At the top, I can see people walking on the street. We hear a mechanical noise again with a large rush of water, sounds a lot closer from before. Everyone but [[Kothvush]] gets their feet wet with sewage, but he waits 10 minutes before coming down the ladder. We get in the boat and start sailing towards a huge pile of shit.

We get out of the boat and keep walking onwards. There's a light at the end of the tunnel, sewage too. We see numbers 2 and 6. We arrive at a section where manmade walls turn to natural cave. [[Glacialmaw]] steps on a tripwire. There is a locked chest. Looks empty... [[Virahck]] casts [[Speak to Animals]] and communicates with [[Sir Schwaggus]] to get him to scurry around the chest and look in. _"It's a box!"_ [[Glacialmaw]] picks it up and starts carrying it with both hands. We decide to go down the river with the boat and are showered in shit.

**THE DULLARD GULL**
[[The Dullard Gull]]
We rush back to the Gull, [[Azurak]] quickly runs to the bathroom and [[Glacialmaw]] updates [[Rickon]] on our adventure and [[Virahck]] starts cleaning the shit off his body at the Sailing School. [[Azurak]] vomits on stage while playing a relatively okay performance. The show ends and [[Dick Crabbe]] won't even speak to us.

**BATHHOUSE** We clean ourselves, for 5 silver each.

**THE DULLARD GULL**
[[The Dullard Gull]]
We smash the chest on the floor of our bedroom, breaking a floorboard, only to confirm that there was nothing inside. _"What the fuck are you guys doing??"_ - [[Rickon]] _"You haven't find the rat already?"_ _"There are some pipes out in the bay that go to the sewers, but I don't really explore often."_ _**LONG REST**_
