### Session Summary


### Log
[[Glacialmaw]] walks over and opens the ([[Inverse Umbrella]]) umbrella that rains on the inside... And a shark attacks, but he jumps out of the way. The shark seems to be moving a bit slower in the wet sand. [[Kothvush]] tries to get tf outta there but gets downed before he can get away. [[Palu]] gets downed too. [[Glacialmaw]] pikes one shark to death. We start to climb up the side of the rocks and then BDSMly tie up the donkeys to lift them up. One of the donkeys drops and crashes into Virahck. Jess is really really fucked up. [[Jess]] dies.

**VALLEY** We travel along the ridge and see a nice pond in the valley with a lil settlement.

**SMALL TOWN** Only one large building, line of stalls for minimal goods - a bizarre market... _[[The Grateful Shed]]_ The lizardfolk are selling the goods. As we walk by the large building, we see a Drow smoking a ciggie - [[Palu]] starts flirting.

**THE GRATEFUL SHED** The band is just about to play... We start munching on beetles and booze. Bartender's name is [[Johnny Sack]]. 2 gold for a room or 5 silver for the common room. [[Uncle Glom's Band]] is playing soon. [[Palu]] orders a round for all of us and chugs another 4. The band is kinda trash... both guitars are out of tune. Plague and famine ravaged [[Draxus]]' family. The [[Demogorgon]] did this and gave him the axe that he draws his power from. [[Jexel Garcia]] announces that they are done for the evening. 

_**SCREAMING**_ Most go back to sleep but some wake up... [[Johnny Sack]] is standing over a body on the ground. [[Jexel Garcia]] is dead! His throat has been recently slit... Some more people emerge from their rooms and it doesn't look like [[Johnny Sack]] killed him, but Johnny suggests it was one of his band mates. **BONFIRE** We see some lizardfolk and humans around a bonfire. It seems like they don't have much of a motive to kill him since [[Jexel Garcia]] writes all the songs and are otherwise untalented. [[Glacialmaw]] attempts to deceive the people and says that we're asking since we want to start a band too. Your frontman has been killed and we need to figure out who did it. We are intimidating as hell. [[Bonnie]] says [[Philly]] might've killed him, they never really got along - he stays at [[The Grateful Shed]]. [[Palu]] drops a copper piece on her and tells her about her shitty playing yesterday.

**PHILLY'S ROOM** We knock politely and [[Glacialmaw]] bangs on the door. "Did you kill your frontman?" "What?? It must've been [[Bone]]." We tie him up.

**THE BAR** We tie up [[Bone]]. "I was smoking a cig outside. [[Jexel Garcia|Jexel]] is such an asshole, so I wasn't worried about it. I was with [[Jurte]] - backup vocals."

**THE PATIO** [[Jurte]] is smoking a cig against the wall. They try and catch her in a lie - instead we catch her in a bunch of fuckin' rope. She said she hadn't seen anybody at the time, but [[Bone]] had said they were smoking together. She hadn't seen anybody since the performance.

**SEANCE** They overhear that we haven't found [[Bis]] - and suggest that he may be at the pond.

**THE POND** [[Virahck]] finds [[Bis]] after searching around - then brings him to [[Kothvush]]'s party circle.

**SEANCE** Everyone starts yelling at each other about who did it. [[Glacialmaw]] tosses him in, too. [[Bis]] questions why we're here and [[Kothvush]] holds up the body. [[Bis]] thinks it's [[Jurte]].

_**CONSIDERATIONS**_ Rhythm Guitar [[Bonnie]] thinks [[Philly]] did it. "They've always had beef." Bassist [[Philly]] thinks it must've been [[Bone]]. "He has always meddled in the dark arts." Keyboard [[Bis]] thinks [[Jurte]] did it. "She wants the frontman spot for herself." Drummer [[Bone]] says he was with [[Jurte]] all night. "Neither of us could have done it." Backup singer [[Jurte]] knows she's innocent. "I haven't seen any of the band members all night."

We string up [[Jurte]] inside the bar and hoist her up by both arms tied to the ceiling pillars, then release the remaining band members, and then finish our long rest.
