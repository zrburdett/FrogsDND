### Session Summary


### Log
Sleeping beauty is asleep so we decide to try and go around it quietly. There's something that's the size of a person made of stone. We get past the circular room and manage to make it past the beast. We see a glowing door when [[Palu]] uses [[Detect Magic]]!

**SECRET DOOR** Lil bitty room with a mat to wipe your feet. Doesn't look like there's a trap behind the next door...

**HALLWAY** Couple of doors in this hallway.

**DOOR #1** "Hexagonal" room with another door - made of solid stone. [[Palu]] tries to turn the handle but it doesn't budge. Ceiling is pointy. [[Virahck]] tries to break it down but breaks his mace in the process.

**DOOR #2** Another door, when [[Glacialmaw]] tries to open the door behind it, he gets shut in from behind. [[Glacialmaw]] and [[Virahck]] try to open the second door and break it down.

**ALTAR ROOM** Cage from floor to ceiling - bone colored. Altar that looks like a man with 4 arms - a skull in each arm. Red stains all around the alter. Hanging around the man at the alter appears to be a set of intestines. No footprints but there are scuffmarks that lead from the cage to the altar. [[Virahck]] gets stuck in the room - then tries to break down the next door.

**GRATE ROOM** The floor around the grate in the middle are slanted and are super stained leading towards the grates. There are several rusty hooks hanging from the ceiling.

**LEFT DOOR** There's a fountain with no walls that hold the liquid - there's green mist coming up from the water. And a door on the other side.

**TOP LEFT DOOR** Large field of purple electricity bouncing between walls.

**TOP RIGHT DOOR** Long hallway filled with barrels and casks bubbling with airlocks - smells like a lot of stuff. Statue of a giant(?) with a rat's head - posing like it's holding up the ceiling. Two more doors on either side. [[Virahck]] and [[Glacialmaw]] open them.

**LEFT HALLWAY DOOR** Long pool of water, bubbling from the bottom. [[Palu]] jumps in and splashes [[Glacialmaw]], [[Kothvush]] slides in gracefully to wash himself off.

**RIGHT HALLWAY DOOR** Coffins and statues in each corner. Statues are humanoid with rat heads. Door in the back made of wood.

**TOP POOL DOOR** More rat statues - 3 in fact. In the back is an enormous roaring fire. Scattered around the fire are scraps are partially burned bits of paper and fabric. Near the fire is a large anvil. Another creepy altar. Don't know of any religious rats but there are wererats... Half human and half rat. [[Virahck]] drips some blood onto the bones of the stone altar... Nothing happens. No full pieces of paper but we start reading some of the burned papers to see maybe what they're from. It looks like a recipe list... Nothing is actually burning in the fire though, no source. [[Palu]] casts [[Thaumaturgy]] to dim the flame - it shrinks a bit but not by much.

**UHH NEXT LEFT DOOR FROM THE SMALLER STONE ALTAR ROOM** Large 4 post bed - a skull embedded in the headboard. Small coffin in the corner - smaller than a human. [[Glacialmaw]] attempts to open the coffin - snapping a bunch of pieces of wood off the side without being able to open it - it's not attached to the floor and there's nothing under it.

**BEDROOM DOOR** Opens to a circular room - with a mandala carved into the stone. Long rectangular stone in the middle. It's a coffin sized stone - inlaid in the stone is a man with a shocked look on his face (( Lookin like a Han Solo moment. )) In his hands is a rat also frozen in stone.

**LEFT MANDALA ROOM** Strange device that appears to be a torture something something. Array of metal wiring extending from the sides n shit. Corpse chained to the wall, an uncomfortable chair with a seat of nails. Virahck lifts the corpses loincloth to reveal a rotting cock.

**TOP TORTURE DOOR** Looks like a pool of swirling water on the ground. At the bottom appears to be a black abyss. [[Glacialmaw]] tosses one of the corpses arms into the swirling pool - it swirls in a circle and disappears in the middle.

**LEFT TORTURE DOOR** A wall of green and black swirling mist that doesn't move. A foot of the corpse gets tossed into this room and it immediately disappears. [[Glacialmaw]] tries again with another limb and looks closely - but _fuckin closes his eyes_ and misses the damn event. We toss in some rope then pull it back out... but it appears to have been severed.

**BOTTOM MANDALA ROOM/LIBRARY** There's a book on top of the bookcase that's open. [[Palu]] opens the greenest book and opens it - it appears to be a dictionary. [[Glacialmaw]] things the books might be possessed. [[Virahck]] opens the book on the top of the shelf - it's written in common. List of instructions that will preserve life in stone. Long list of ingredients that we mostly don't recognize - satyrs hoof, liquid stone, milk of a basilisk, a beast's heart. In different handwriting on the side of the page - "Rehydrate with the oil of consciousness. [[Palu]] looks for more books in languages that he knows - nothing really but _**[[All the Many Histories of Tapu Ero]]**_ stands out. It goes back about 400 years. [[Palu]] looks through the rest of the open book about preserved stone. The next page is a different recipe. The previous page is a different recipe. There's a recipe for the [[Oil of Consciousness]] - need garlic oil, drip of thought, and an elemental droplet.

**BOTTOM LIBRARY DOOR** (( Dexter's )) Laboratory ! Lots of shit on the tables. Large glass jugs with liquids, taxidermied animals, flayed mice, cauldron with dried crust, small flame still burning. Semi full flasks. Pile of scrolls. Don't find oil of consciousness but do find elemental droplets and garlic oil. Scrolls are looked at - most are recipe scrolls, but there is a magical scroll - written in a language that [[Palu]] can speak. Palu reads the magic scroll - [[Encode Thoughts]] (pull a memory or idea and put it into a thought strand). We pocket some scrolls. We see a [[driftglobe]] and [[Kothvush]] claims.

**BOTTOM LAB DOOR** Connected to the fountain room. Store room, dried ingredients, glassware, tray of cutting tools.

**SAND ROOM** Sand mandala - nothing else.

**LAB** [[Palu]] thinks dirty dirty thoughts and pulls a thought from his brain - a small sparkling strand is pulled from his brain. We place the strand into a glass vial from the store room - it starts humping the wall of the vial. [[Kothvush]] mixes the rest of the ingredients together - the color changes into a rich blue and we seem to have created the [[Oil of Consciousness]].

**STONE MAN ROOM** We pour the [[Oil of Consciousness]] onto the stone man and it starts melting away. He's got a massive erection and is holding a squeaking rat. Gaunt man with dark shadows, receding hairline, tufty and brown hair. Pair of boxers. Says "Did the guards finally get in here??" He backs up against the door. _"My father told you about this place??"_ Palu reaches towards his throbbing cock but the man jumps out of the way. _"I'm glad [[Marshall Matters]] didn't get in here..."_ _"I was preparing the pool and fell in."_ - We don't think he's lying. _"I like to make statues, plenty of bodies turn up in the sewers - I use the bodies so I don't have to carve them totally by hand."_ _"I have a love for wererats. I'll be honest with you - I like to study them and like to experiment their bodies to try and give them some semblance of life back... Some experiments have escaped..."_ _"I may need some help with something... if you're interested, of course."_
