### Session Summary


### Log
**COMMON ROOM** We awake from our slumber. [[Azurak]] plays some music but gets a boot thrown at him cause many people are still asleep in the common room. It doesn't look like [[Mo]] has slept at all...

_**BREAKFAST**_ [[Glacialmaw]] takes up one side of the booth and the rest of us are on the other. We tryna eat... Breakfast comes with the reservation - today is pancakes and sausages. I haven't seen my son in the few days... he has a study in the sewers somewhere. Performance in exchange for 3 private rooms for the night. _"Do ya like games, [[Dick Crabbe]]?"_ - [[Mo]] _"High or low, for 1 gold."_ - Dick Dick wins a gold. Dick loses a gold.

**SAILING SCHOOL** Private covered dock, salt stained little building. 5 people milling about, bookcases mini library, tables, half-orc up front wearing a captains hat. [[Germ Knot]] pushes past [[Azurak]] and shows a ring on her finger to the half-orc. He inspects the ring as says great to meet you in common, then says something in Orcish. This woman is orc nobility - from a lesser house but nobility is nobility. She is from [[Orcida]], similar to Florida but better. The half-orc's name is [[Cug Gorad]]. [[Germ Knot]] is considering leaving the party. Come back on Monday if you want to take the sailing class. She was heading to [[Tapu Ero]] to find her father but was kidnapped, so now she is going to return to [[Orcida]]. There are the [[Andees Whirlpools]] - very treacherous waters. 3 days journey from here to Wishbone. 1 week or longer for the [[Andees]]. [[Iwo Jima]] is famous for it's active volcano. Giants live at [[Frostfang]].

**THE WEDGE** More than 30 stalls and tents, some permanent brick and mortar shops.
[[Periwinkles Monster Meats]] Stands for pretty much everything.
[[The Flopping Fish]] - all trout
[[Whispered Wigs]]
[[Meads and Munchies]]
[[Horse Throat Horses]]
[[Gemisons]]
[[Miguel's Magic Emporium]]

**HORSE THROAT HORSES** 350 gold for the largest horse Ponies for 80 gold [[Sir Schwaggus]] wants to eat peanuts.

**PEANUT STALL** 5 copper for a bag of nuts [[Virahck]] gives the man enough money for 10 bags.

**BOOKSTORE** [[Glacialmaw]] starts looking for language books, wildlife of the island books, etc. The bookkeeper brings a book on plants and herbs of [[Tapu Ero]]. Giant book costs 100 gold. Collection of poetry written in Elvish that bookkeeper [[John Dynamo]] has written. [[Glacialmaw]] buys the plants and herbs book for 5 gold. He has a copy of [[The Black Book]] - not sure how much I would charge, very very rare. It's very small, but all black with white ink. The first page discusses a warning about bringing the dead back to life. It costs 300 gold.

**PERIWINKLES MONSTER MEATS** 
[[Periwinkles Monster Meats]]
Large, red faced woman behind the counter. We have plenty of salted meats. [[Mo]] asks about purple meats. They have pricy meats of a purple worm. They are VERY difficult to kill. 3,500 for a 5 pound slab. Beef, pork, dog, horse meats. [[Glacialmaw]] notices something that looks like troll meat... 200 pounds for 1,000 gold Glacialmaw intimidates the shopkeeper into giving a heavy discount and free cured beef.

**MIGUEL'S MAGIC EMPORIUM**
[[Miguel's Magic Emporium]]
Long black cloak, pointed hat wearing human. He shows us a magic trick with a globe. This is an [[Orb of Illusion]] - only 10 gold! He shows [[Azurak]] the [[Inverse Umbrella]] - it only rains on the inside. [[Rock of Detect Gravity]] - 5 silver. [[Wand of Create Magic Object]] - it makes another wand exactly like it. He shows us an [[Immovable Rod]] - 30 gold. [[Glacialmaw]] buys a squirting flower. [[The Simpleton's Rock]] will convince people that it's a 5,000 gold gem if they fail Wis saving throw.

**GEMISONS**
[[Gemisons]]
[[Waeryn Gemison]] owns this place. Waeryn inspects the gems on [[Virahck]]'s chainmail. There are glyphs on the inside of [[Virahck]]'s chainmail belt. Waeryn offers 2,600 to replace and fix the chainmail. [[Palu]] makes a copy of the glyphs for future reference. Palu thinks it may be a dialect derived from infernal?

**THE DULLARD GULL**
[[The Dullard Gull]]
We approach [[Dick Crabbe]] and ask about his son. [[Rickon]], a quiet thin man, much more hair than I have, brown hair, he does have legs thank you very much, has all his fingers too. A bit of a tinkerer. Dabbles in magic but likes to experiment with machines. He enters the [[Eroll Cove Sewers]] north of the wedge, just on the outside of the wall to the upper city. You can enter through the grates in the ground. He has a... room that he's created in the sewers, but it's rather private. Don't need anybody else to know about it. Hug the left wall, go past the enormous room with the circular pool of water. Just past there, there is a hidden door for his room. There is a reward - rooms, food, gold, information, something along those lines. Dick treats us all to lunch - he makes pancakes but these ones have nuts and bananas and are much better than the breakfast pancakes. [[Azurak]] needs to be at the gull at 7. Maybe 10% of the shops earnings during the performance?

_**THE PERFORMANCE**_ The gull is PACKED and [[Azurak]] KILLS it. Beautifully lit, [[Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata]] on the bagpipes. Encore is played too. [[Azurak]] ends the show with 2 beautiful women and [[Dick Crabbe]] hands him 30 gold. [[Azurak]] goes into the bathroom and cries. _**LONG REST**_
