### Log
[[King Fleshbarg]] refused and let the city fell, along with the great strength of the Giant race. [[Dal Glug]]... He ruled [[Tapu Ero]] when [[Macknus]] still existed. I had no idea he was a vampire. He was one of the leaders I urged [[King Fleshbarg]] to meet with. He held one of the keys to the portal. I was told there are [[Keys of the Beast|6 keys]] total, distributed to each race (giant, troll, orc, gnome, lizardfolk, and goblins) that assisted in creating the lock. I haven't kept up with the location of the keys since we abandoned the [[Material Plane]]. He picks up the [[Glimpsing Gem]] - I'm not sure what I just saw. [[Keys of the Beast|The keys]] aren't known to do this. We chose this location for the boulder in the trees. When I first sat upon the rock, something told me to place the [[Mushroom Trinket]] on the rock, and then it merged with the rock and has been there since. Exiting the [[Feywild]] shouldn't be too hard, try swimming in the water. You may stay in [[Sherman]] as long as you want and return any time. There's a reflection in [[Sorflow]] with many residents, but there are other [[Feywild]] camps along the way. Back when I was a boy, I was told of rumors that circulated that there was a powerful figure that had control over this beast - **[[The Beastrider]]**. [[Draxus]] recognizes that it sounds pretty demonic. [[The Beastrider]] must've played a hand in the death and destruction that [[The Beast|the beast]] itself caused. The intentions of the gnomish and lizardfolkians are to release the beast as well, but many of them have been pushed off the [[Wishbones]]. There's an Orcish society to the west, a good amount of gnomes, too. [[Palu]] explains her [[Midas Touch]]. [[Glacialmaw]] settles [[Draxus]]' debt for a bean and a piece of fruit. [[Pailoff]] tells [[Palu]] not to touch anything while he's here.

#### _**WRAPPING UP**_
[[Glacialmaw]] heads off to a giant temple and gives an offering before praying. [[Glacialmaw]] feels a calm and warming energy run through his body. A clouded image begins to clear in his head. He can see the stone in the center of the city, but [[Mushroom Trinket|the mushroom]] isn't stone anymore. When he rises, the mushroom is back to stone. [[Draxus]] and others heads to the library. 40-50 foot tall bookcases with no ladders. [[Draxus]] asks the guard for a librarian, but there's only really a maintenance guy that organized the books. He doesn't really find much of anything. [[Glacialmaw]] sits by the rock to sleep rather than the guest quarters. [[Draxus]] sees visions of an unidentified massive beast under the steam. While [[Glacialmaw]] is sleeping by the mushroom, he sees the vision of the mushroom over and over again. We fall asleep one by one...

#### _**MUSHROOM**_
[[Glacialmaw]] wakes up in the morning, and then picks up the [[Mushroom Trinket]]. The world melts away from him as if he's in a different place. Instead of the mushroom sprouting beneath his feet, [[Mushroom Trinket|the mushroom]] is in his hand and it's growing in his hands, sprouting down his body. It grows and grows and looks at [[Glacialmaw]], "Hmm... you seem like a fun guy. It leaves his body then jumps into him, and he feels a new power filling him. Waking back up, [[Glacialmaw]] is holding the mushroom on a chain. _[[Sherman Mushroom Charm|SHERMAN MUSHROOM CHARM]] obtained!_

[[Palu]] touches the side table and it doesn't turn to gold. It looks like the curse of the [[Midas Touch]] has been lifted! We head to the kitchen and pocket a bunch of food. [[Palu]] tells us over breakfast that her pillow is solid gold now and wants to bring it to the blacksmith to melt it down and use it for something. [[Draxus]] lightning lures it to the blacksmith, leaving a horrible line of scrapes along the wooden floor. The blacksmith is confused but [[Palu]] persuades him to take the job. [[Draxus]] plants a bean and a giant blue campfire erupts on the ground - it's big and hot and blue. [[Draxus]] retrieves the bean that [[Glacialmaw]] left at the shrine. [[Palu]] gets a gold chain with a pot leaf on it. It's incredibly heavy... We leave [[Sherman]] and make our way back to the pond and swim in the water. When we submerge ourselves, we can see a tiny hole and notice that this is where the bubbles were coming from in the material plane - we do so and alas! We have returned to the [[Material Plane]]. We are back on the cliff from before and... no dinghy. We can see [[Lightning McQueen|the ship]], but the dinghy is just gone.

#### _**LEVEL SEVEN!**_
