*< [[Frogs Campaign S1E18]] | [[Frogs Campaign S1E20]] >*

### Last time


### Session Summary


### Log
**BUILDING** We enter the building. Sitting at a bench on the floor is an elder (800 years old range - whatever super old for an elf is) pale skinned elf - [[Caedmon Thorne]]. There are notes and things on the bench. He is wary of us, but smiles at [[Ebu Tart]]. We inquire about refuge from the guild. He responds by stating that this place was created as refuge from the guild, and the rest of world at large. We tell [[Caedmon Thorne|Caedmon]] about the [[Glimpsing Gem]] and the powers it bestows. We ask about what the deal is in exchange for the artifact. [[Caedmon Thorne|Caedmon]] can provide refuge, but still does not understand the artifact. He will guarantee our safety here, as much as he can. [[Caedmon Thorne|Caedmon]] takes the [[Glimpsing Gem]]. After a few minutes, he gasps and sets the [[Glimpsing Gem]] down, and says he saw [[Dal Glug]] - he has definitely returned. He said we were there too. At the top of a volcano - we were standing knee deep in the magma, winds carried [[Caedmon Thorne|Caedmon]] away towards the sea. Heard something in a language he did not know. He saw a figure waiting for him - someone who was missing from the [[Shadow of the Knife]]. Follow the wind. [[Urgon Walfa]] definitely has something to do with this - it would be best to find him. He travels often between here, [[Logor]], and the [[Lonely Peak]] - west of here. He is essentially the village trader. The guild is mostly on the eastern side of the island, mainly being in [[Sorflow]]. They also have a small chapter in [[Parid Glenn]]. There are various beasts on the [[Wishbones]], and people are likely to be on the main trails. [[Urgon Walfa]] is a trader, doesn't like to stay in one place for very long. He's made the trip between locations hundreds of times, usually gone for 3 weeks, but currently gone for about 8 or 9. What should we know about [[Dal Glug]]? Has read about [[Dal Glug]] 250/300 years ago. Never lived in that part of the world, vampires want blood, suffering, and want to conquer the world. He will likely try to build an army and take it further from there to spread his control.

_**DINNER**_ Rustic curry with rice, given a bedroll, share a room for sleeping.

_**TIME TO REST?**_ We sit in the our communal room and begin talking about the stone, eventually all touching it to learn what may soon happen...

>[!info] ***Palu's Vision***
>A bird flies overhead, and [[Palu]] finds herself before the mouth of a cave. Behind her, a vast open forest, glowing with sunrays and dripping with dew. Beyond the mouth, the cave is black and silent, swallowing sounds and light like a river swallows a waterfall. Teeth emerge from the roof and floor, and the cave coughs before it speaks, spraying [[Palu]] with a dank moisture.
>
>"The moment came, the [[Red Child|red child]] was born. Now in the final life, the lost one wanders hopelessly. Once the sky burns with fire, they shall know their purpose and they will mourn. The end of history and the downfall of an empire, will it be you who acted so atrociously?"
>
>The cave's tongue stretches from it's dark mouth, wrapping [[Palu]] and pulling her into the shadows. She sees piles upon piles of gold before the teeth clamp shut, swallowing her and the world in darkness.

>[!info] ***Glacialmaw's Vision***
>Trees sprout from the ground, towering over [[Glacialmaw]] like [[Glacialmaw]] over an ant. The crisp air bites at his skin as the wind whips past. A light snow covers the forest floor, crunching under [[Glacialmaw]]'s heavy footsteps. A mushroom sprouts from the ground beneath his feet, red and white, bulging with hydration. The mushroom grows as [[Glacialmaw]] stands before it, first to his toes, then to his knees, waist, shoulders, and above his head. Arms and legs sprout from the sides, and the mushroom man stands, towering over [[Glacialmaw]] like the trees around them. It's eyes open, yellow like starfruit, and it smiles.
>
>"Those who you have wronged shall create destruction. Was it theirs or your construction? Find me, and be reborn. Help the [[Man in Green|man in green]] bring forth a generation of health and rise of the poor. Nature surrounds your tiny frame, will you succeed or continue to fail more?"

>[!info] ***Draxus' Vision***
>The world around [[Draxus]] twists away, disappearing into darkness. Again, [[Draxus]] finds himself walking in his old village in the [[Underdark]], the corpses of his friends, families, and neighbors littering the streets. Laughter rings in his ears, echoing so loudly it stings, growing louder with every step. He soon realizes the laughter is coming from himself. A dark green shadow emerges from his feet, spreading across the ground, slowly covering the world around him. The shadow spreads, leaving the [[Underdark]] and infecting the overworld before spreading out into other planes. [[Draxus]] stands in the center of the spread, along in the infected world. The shadow spreads up his body, covering his skin and sealing him within.
>
>A booming voice speaks in a sharp tone, "When the land flows like water, the [[Man in Green|man clad in green]] shall have ushered forth a cursed age of calamity. When the sky burns dark with flame on the wild, the [[Man in Green|man in green]] shall be covered in insanity. Will his pain linger? Or his humanity?"

>[!info] ***Kothvush's Vision***
>Sweat stings at [[Kothvush]]'s eyes. When he blinks, he finds himself atop a mountain, staring down at the world below. Crowds of people cover the land, reaching up towards him, begging for something, anything. Their screams and cheers make the hair on his arms stand and send shivers down his spine. A flash of the past crosses his mind and he looks above in hopes of escaping it. The sunlight beats down on his purple skin, clashing with the shivers that linger. The sun opens its wide mouth, and asks, "When the moment comes that the white smoke rises above, the world will call. When the silver turns to gold, can anyone scale the wall? After the rest have fallen, will you continue the crawl?"
>
>The cliffside he stood above crumbles away, and [[Kothvush]] finds himself falling towards the crowd. Their hands get closer and closer until... he blinks and is back in the burial chamber.

> [!info] ***Virahck's Vision***
> [[Virahck]] finds himself in a vast green field, running endlessly from horizon to horizon. A stone titan approaches, heavy footsteps shaking the world, stooping down to the ground so its enormous eye is level with [[Virahck]]'s. [[Virahck]] realizes he is naked, and attempts to cover himself. The titan's eye judges [[Virahck]], and his mouth opens.
>
> A gentle voice, as soft as the wind, emerges. "Find the source that hides within. On the day that is the shortest, the [[Children of Darkness|children of darkness]] shall bring forth an age of sin. Duel the forces outside and in, or flee before the end begins."

_**BREAKFAST**_ [[Glacialmaw]] attempts to cook eggs, but we have to pick out pebbles and eggshells from our meals. We placed some of out loot in our place and go to find [[Caedmon Thorne|Caedmon]] and tell him that we are headed to find [[Urgon Walfa]]. He suggests that we place our valuables in a secure place - they aren't very money motivated, so our things are likely fine to be left here. The [[Lonely Peak]] is almost exclusively populated by giants, but they are used to travelers - town is near the summit.

_**ONWARDS**_ We move forward through the night. In the morning, it begins to gently rain. We take some time to rest. [[Palu]] gets attacked!

_**COMBAT**_ With three [[Owlbear|owlbears]] [[Draxus]] creates magical darkness that kinda fucks us up to start, but is much rougher for the owlbears. We fuuuuuck them up, then go to inspect our burnt equipment. Our bag of holding was destroyed. _**LONG REST**_
