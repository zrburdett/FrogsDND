### Session Summary


### Log
[[Urgon Walfa]] had a room in [[Logor]], but doesn't really care about returning. We head north - [[Urgon Walfa|Urgon]] is... really slow... but we put him on the trusty steed. The curse on him is lifted but he hasn't eaten recently - [[Palu]] feeds him. We see a small black dog run near us, then disappear... We set up camp for the night and go to bed. [[Kothvush]] is thrashing in his sleep and [[Palu]] looks over, interested.

**PALEBANK** We find the road to the east of the lonely mountain. [[Palebank]] is a cavern in [[Ulith Pass]]. There's a blank cliff face where a magical door would open, but when we arrive, the door is already visible and doesn't need the incantation. [[Ebu Tart]] is surprised and shocked - [[Urgon Walfa]] too. We arrive at [[Palebank]] itself, but we don't see or hear anybody. We hear a scratchy growly voice up ahead. Three figures are speaking amongst themselves - their skin is rather pale. [[Draxus]] confronts them. One of them smiles and says "We're looking for some friends, too! The friends we're looking for - I'm told many of them live here. Told by... our close friend and employer in [[Tapu Ero]]." [[Draxus]] attempts to make it seem like he has a split personality disorder when referencing 'we.' "We've been told not to divulge their names, but they are important. We're looking for [[Caedmon Thorne]] and his affiliates. We can introduce you to our employer if you provide information." [[Draxus]] threatens to start blastin'. They get aggressive towards [[Draxus]]. [[Draxus]] senses another one of them approaching. [[Draxus]] starts blastin'.
