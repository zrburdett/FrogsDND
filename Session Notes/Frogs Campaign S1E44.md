### Session Summary
With most of the party safe inside the back offices of the [[Hotel D'Lemaer]], [[Draxus]] casts Find Familiar, conjuring an owl who flies out into the city, allowing [[Draxus]] to get a bird's eye view of 100 feet surrounding the building. The streets are mostly empty, but there are a few people near the Circle, but it's hard to tell who they are or what they're doing. [[Draxus]] instructs the owl to search around for [[Palu]].

Meanwhile, [[Palu]] has just broken out of her jail cell and is now wandering the hallway. As she closes the door behind her and makes her way past the other cells, one of the prisoners gets her attention and pleads for her to release him. She agrees but she needs the keys so she continues down the hallway looking for her belongings and a way out.

Peeking into door number one, she sees some sort of administration office with three guards looking out of the window. In the room, there are a few cubbies full of stuff and some chests, too. Checking what's behind door number two, she sees what appear to be the barracks, with about four guards sleeping in the bunk beds. She attempts to open door number three, but it seems to be blocked from the other side. She pushes harder and eventually the door opens to a broom closet, which she discretely creeps into.

Using the newfound cover, she casts thaumaturgy several times, causing the doors to the other two rooms to fly open and creating a noise that sounds like the cell doors being broken open. The guards run towards the sound, leaving [[Palu]] the opportunity to get a better look at the administration room. Inside, she opens a few of the chests and grabs her belongings in addition to two other backpacks before casting Fly and jumping out the window, flying upwards away from view.

Once in a safer place, she opens the two other bags, yielding a soft and luxurious pillow, a seashell necklace, and a carved wooden sculpture of a snail about the size of her head - it's actually quite detailed! When looking at the seashell necklace, she is reminded of a mermaid sigil which she has seen before in [[Yi]], but she can't quite remember where.

She continues south, coming across crying children sat next to dead bodies and a group of gnomes dressed in clown costumes heading towards the docks. They tell her that her friends are probably dead and it's best to get the fuck out of [[Yi]] or else she's gonna die too as the city has been overrun.

[[Palu]] continues on south, passing by the destroyed [[Prying Pumpkin]] and seeing a group of 7 humanoids walking north on Main Street with one carrying a bag with the letters *SW* embroidered on the side. She tries to hide from the group but then she spots a red bat overlooking the area. The bat is staring directly at her and even with the distraction of thaumaturgy creating a high pitched screeching noise down the alleyway, the bat doesn't flinch and it's eyes remains locked on her.

[[Palu]] attacks the bat, who then flies towards the ground, shifting it's form into a cloaked humanoid who immediately charges [[Palu]] in an attempt to bite her. Combat ensues and, unfortunately due to the loud noise of the thaumaturgy, the group of seven show up. They take one look at the cloaked man and say, "I never thought I'd get a chance to meet you, [[Damien]]." The cloaked man responds by telling the group that he was simply here to survey what [[Dal Glug]] has been up to, but that he sees no reason to fight the group - he lets [[Palu]] go for the group of 7 vampire spawn to attack.

[[Damien]] transforms back into a bat and flies away with [[Palu]] trying to cast Fly and get away as well, but one of the vampire spawn is able to grab her leg and slam her back down onto the ground.

[[Draxus]], looking through his owl's eyes, sees the flash of [[Palu]]'s fire spells and he awakens the party, telling us that he found [[Palu]] and that she needs our help. We all stir out of bed (except [[Virahck]] who takes a little longer) and we join the combat.

[[Draxus]] conjures a sphere of darkness filled with unknown horrors, trapping several of the vampire spawn, but unfortunately, catching the injured [[Palu]] as well. As the encounter goes on, the damage done to [[Palu]] from the vampire spawn is just too much and she succumbs to her injuries, feeling the sweet kiss of death as [[Draxus]]' magical darkness consumes her...

In [[Palu]]'s last moments alive, her mind travels back to a time when she was cast out of her harmonious village. Shuffled out unjustly, she sought vengeance but those in power were seemingly untouchable. Instead of focusing her energy on fruitless efforts, she left her village and went on her own quest for personal enlightenment, finding it in solitude. Her last thoughts were not of her happiest moments, but rather, she thought back to all of the moments in which she has taken life throughout the years. She remembers all the people she struck down and reminisces on her own crisis, seeing herself caught in the grips of death's cold embrace. Frozen cold and completely alone in the darkness in which she once found comfort in.

The vampire spawn are strong and the party struggles to keep up as [[Virahck]] falls to the ground as well, but out of nowhere, an unknown fish-looking humanoid appears next to [[Kothvush]], slashing one of the vampire spawn with his trident. The party looks towards him, confused and questioning, but happy that another is fighting with them...

### Log
The majority of us are in the [[Hotel D'Lemaer]] while [[Palu]] has finally broken out of her jail cell. The hotel is quite the luxurious place, but the lobby is currently abandoned due to the attack. We set ourselves up in one of the back offices, hoping to stay safe while our comrades heal their wounds. [[Draxus]] casts Find Familiar and conjures an owl, using it to look around the area for [[Palu]] and any other obstacles we may encounter.

[[Draxus]], through the owl's eyes, sees empty streets and a few people in the Circle, but it's hard to say who they are or what they're doing. [[Draxus]] telepathically instructs the owl to search for [[Palu]].

Meanwhile in jail, [[Palu]] has just broken out of her cell. She doesn't see any guards for now, but she looks down the hallway and sees more cell doors. She closes the door behind her as to not draw attention. She attempts to remain stealthy and look for her belongings. The hall has quite the echo and she makes some noise. A prisoner tells her to let him out. He's been here a couple weeks. [[Palu]] keeps moving as more and more prisoners start looking through the doors at her, likely hoping to get released as well.

There's a fork in the hallway - [[Palu]] goes towards the doors and turns the handle, peeking inside. She sees 3 guards, all looking through the window. There's a table with some food and chairs, some cubbies. None of the guards notice her at first.

Peeking into the middle room, she sees several bunk beds with some guards sleeping in them. There are about 4 guards appearing to sleep. She leaves the door cracked.

She tries to open the third door, but it feels like something is blocking the door from the other side. She attempts to push the door open - the door seems to be pushing something. It was a broom that was blocking the door of a small broom closet.

She casts thaumaturgy, creating a sound from inside the broom closet with the sound of cell doors breaking open. She casts thaumaturgy again to cause the doors of the two guards rooms to fly open as well. The three guards from the admin room stir quickly and start swiftly making their way towards the cells. Some additional footsteps are heard coming from the barracks too.

She goes to the admin room and quickly looks for her belongings. She opens some of the trunks and sees some kind of worthless items, some necklaces, a straw hat, etc. She looks into another chest and it looks like all of her items are in it. The window is open, but she's on the third floor so it's a steep drop. She looks through her bag for some spellcasting components to allow her to fly. She grabs her stuff including a spellcasting component. She also grabs two bags on her way out.

She hears heavy footsteps coming back towards the admin room. She jumps out the window and casts fly, going upwards. She sees the 50 foot walls surrounding Central with dozens and dozens of bowmen, protecting the central part of the city.

With three bags in her possession, she lands and rummages through the bags, finding:
- One bag is full of... blob? It's a very soft pillow with a tag that reads: "NORTHERN SEA, something DOWN PILLOW - FAMED FOR LUXERIOUS SOFT"
- The second bag has a seashell necklace with a carved mermaid as the charm. There's a pair of dirty pants, covered in dust and grass stains. A trowel, and at the bottom, there's a detailed carved wooden snail the size of [[Palu]]'s head.

[[Palu]] thinks back to any imagery of mermaids... She remembers a mermaid sigil from somewhere in the city, but can't quite remember from where. She ditches the pants and the bags, flying away with the mermaid, snail, pillow, and her own belongings. The sun is setting now. [[Palu]] heads towards a place which might not have many guards. She heads south and sees a young child crying out for their parents with several lifeless bodies on the street.

She continues south, seeing 6 gnomes in clown costumes heading towards the docks. She sees that most of the ships that were in the bay are actively sailing away; there are only 4 boats still at the docks. She approaches the group and asks what the hell is going on.

The gnomes explain the situation that there was an attack after the pyramid appeared. [[Palu]] asks what happened to the festival? They respond that it's... probably cancelled. The clowns are disappointed that she isn't fleeing and is instead going to try and find her friends.

[[Palu]] pulls her cloak up tight to conceal herself, but keeps walking around the city, looking for any signs of her friends. She sees the mostly destroyed [[Prying Pumpkin]]. The area is rather quiet but several of the windows have been covered with cloth, wood, and other various others to shield them from the outside. She approaches the [[Circus of the Mind Arcade]]. She sees a group of 7 walking down the street away from her. She doesn't notice any identifying features or anything, but the one in the front is holding a large sized blue silk bag. There are two silver letters glowing on the bag: *SW*. She doesn't want any trouble so she doesn't inquire further.

Unsurprisingly, the arcade is ***not*** poppin'. Luckily it's not collapsed though. She maintains her stealth and tries not to be seen. She ducks into the alleyway and tries to remember what *SW* might mean... but nothing comes to mind, just a sense of familiarity. She notices that there is a small red bat perched on the top of the circus tent. The bat stares into [[Palu]]'s eyes.

[[Palu]] casts thaumaturgy, creating a high pitched screeching noise deep into the alley, hoping to distract it. The bat doesn't flinch and it's eyes remain locked on her. She casts Magic Missile in an attempt to kill it.

The red bat shifts into form on the ground as a man in a black cloak and he rushes and attempts to bite [[Palu]].

***COMBAT***

[[Palu]] casts fireball and buildings are coated in fire, but the vampire appears to avoid most of the damage - he swiftly pounces and punches [[Palu]] with a closed fist. He sinks his teeth into her and [[Palu]] becomes grappled. As he bites her, she hears heavy footsteps coming down the alleyway. The footsteps grow closer and she sees 7 additional vampires emerge, one of which is holding the blue silk *SW* bag. They seem surprised at the sight of this vampire. They all laugh at her when [[Palu]] says she's one of them, a dhampir.

"I never thought I'd get a chance to meet you, [[Damien]]." [[Palu]] remembers a vampire who has lived in the [[Andees]] for thousands of years. She remembers that he's missing the middle finger on his left hand.

The rest of the party wakes in their sleep, hearing a high pitched screeching sound from the front of the building. [[Palu]] asks [[Damien]], "I've lived for centuries, all I want is to die." His eyes move from the crowd of vampire spawn and speaks to [[Palu]], "The gift can only be given, not taken. It seems these gentlemen may be able to offer you that gift though, momentarily it seems." He turns to the group, "I was simply here to survey, seeing what [[Dal Glug]] has been up to. I see no value in fighting you here. I'll leave you with this prize." He lets go of [[Palu]] and transforms back into a bat, flying up into the air.

[[Palu]] immediately casts fly and goes straight up into the air. The closest vampire spawn attempts to grab [[Palu]]'s leg, pulling her out of the air and slamming her on the ground.

[[Draxus]]' owl sees a flash of fire in the distance and [[Draxus]] peeks out of the window, looking for what's happening. The owl flies closer and [[Draxus]] can look through it's eyes again, seeing [[Palu]] getting attacked.

Some of the party gets up quickly and runs out of the [[Hotel D'Lemaer]] while [[Virahck]] is still out of it.

*We join the combat.*

[[Draxus]] makes a 20 foot radius of darkness within a 20 foot radius. Magical darkness with the tentacles and cold damage.

[[Kothvush]] stuns one of the vampire spawn.

[[Palu]] goes down within the darkness.

[[Virahck]] makes it to the battle.

The kiss of death is sweet for [[Palu]] as the darkness of [[Draxus]]'s magical darkness consumes her...

The vampire spawn continue to reinvigorate themselves at the beginning of each round.

A person emerges from the south side of the alleyway. He appears next to [[Kothvush]] and slashes one of the vampire spawn with his trident.

[[Palu]]'s reminescense in life is that she was blackballed out of being within her harmonious village, living among her people. She was shuffled out unjustly and sought vengeance, but it appeared to be fruitless. Instead, she went on her own quest for personal enlightenment and found it in solitude. She was then captured by guards for seemingly no reason, when she was dying, her thoughts did not go to her happiest thoughts, but rather, to singular instances in which she watched people she murdered die. It was her own crisis, imagining herself dying as she was the cause of so much death. Flashbacks from all the people she has killed in the past.
