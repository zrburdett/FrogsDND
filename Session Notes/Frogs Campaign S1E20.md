### Session Summary


### Log
_**ONWARDS**_ [[Ebu Tart]] leads us towards the next place. Travel a few days and arrive at the base of the mountain. Biggest mountain we've seen on the [[Wishbones]]. We take the shorter path. We come to a cliff face with a well marked way to climb up, approximately 25-30 feet tall. If you fall, you will likely roll for a while. Trees, rocks, on the top area. Straight ahead is another vertical wall but the path leads away from the wall. [[Kothvush]] ties a beautiful knot to a tree and tosses the rope down for the rest of them. [[Palu]] gives [[Hess]] the ability to fly temporarily and they balloon up the side of the cliff, before we pull them back towards us and move forwards on the path. We continue further and further, snow begins to fall, and we see a stone building. One room, set of stairs. Three-walled room with a roof.

**SHRINE** Small stone platform with a burning incense on top of it. There aren't any symbols on it, but [[Glacialmaw]] gets the sense that this is a giant shrine. Seems like it's a general shrine, maybe the Father of All Giants - [[Annam]]. He apparently birthed all the giants but then left them, according to the mythology. [[Ebu Tart]] has seen this shrine before when they were up here, but there's never been incense burning. [[Glacialmaw]] leaves some money, [[Virahck]] attempts to leave an unlucky rabbit's foot, but [[Glacialmaw]] takes it off.

**PATH** Follow the path for 20-30 minutes and some of us get the sense that we're being watched. There's a strange silence, uncomfortable. [[Virahck]] senses something evil... The wind gets worse, the snowfall gets heavier. After a few more hours, the snow gets pretty deep - 1.5 feet or so. We're starting to feel rather cold. [[Draxus]] still thinks something is following us, but at a further distance. It is getting to evening and we still have about 8 hours ahead of us. To one side of us, there's a rather steep drop-off, on the other side is another steep incline leading up. There wouldn't be a ton of cover by the drop-off, a few scattered trees, not much of anything to hide behind here.

**CLEARING** [[Ebu Tart]] warns us that it's hard to see but just past this clearing, there is a cliff. Do not fall off. We set up the magical boat and then enter the cabin. [[Virahck]] sees a big, thick, and hairy figure in the snow. [[Glacialmaw]] yells out to it, but it doesn't respond. Looks like a monkey, gorilla, big rams horn, big claws, standing upright, white hair. [[Draxus]] shoots two eldritch blasts at the creature and it is pushed off the side of the cliff. We wake up in the morning and it feels colder today.

_**CONTINUING FORWARD**_ We keep going on the path.

**VILLAGE** Several giants walking around, interacting, farming. Sitting outside a lean-to sharpening a scythe is a giant, who [[Glacialmaw]] introduces us to. _In Giant:_ We are looking for [[Urgon Walfa]]. "Urgon is so pleasant and interesting! He can drink as much as we can." "We have a shrine over there, yes." (that we passed) We ask about when [[Urgon Walfa|Urgon]] was here last. Giant seems sad that he is missing. "He was here about 2 months ago. Up here, we grow a certain strain of flower called [[Ploracco]] - brown plant that grows in the winter. You get a buzz when you smoke it. When Urgon came, he traded platinum and alcohol in exchange for [[Ploracco]]. He mentioned that he was headed to [[Logor]]." "You probably encountered a [[Yeti]]. There's a small tribe of yeti near the top of the mountain, but they don't interact with us much. They don't even speak giant."

_**BOOKS**_ Giant Children's Books/Bedtime stories [[Three Dwarves and a Hole Cookbook]]

_**NIGHT**_ [[Palu]] feels a hunger growing ever since she was bitten by the vampire. [[Palu]] has a dream of somebody walking through a snowy mountain, coming across a family of small yeti. He sees [[Glacialmaw]]'s hands and feet, then wakes up in the morning at the same time as [[Glacialmaw]].

_**ELDER CONVERSATION**_ [[Glacialmaw]] speaks to the elder of the town. [[Auril]] is an angry goddess and it's troubling that many are now worshipping her. Some have joined out of greed, others out of strength. The giants used to have a dynasty in several places, but now are reclusive and having from the rest of the world. [[Glacialmaw]] left their home because of this tension in the family between gods. Elder thinks [[Glacialmaw]] must return home to confront the changes. Most beings must confront their most painful moments at some point in time. [[Glacialmaw]] says a prophecy says the giant kingdom will return in some way. The prophecy seems to scream rebirth, change, and all things necessary for the return of the giant's greatness. He wonders about the mushroom and the yellow eyes. It's strange. You certainly have a role to play in any change that is to occur. Hmm the [[Man in Green|man in green]]... It could mean so much. Green could mean growth or life in this instance, but who is to say who it could be. You and your friends are always welcome here.

_**[[Virahck]]'s Greatsword**_ Platinum with giant runes inscribed into the side of it - they hold great significance to giants, some say they have magical powers, it's old giant. PLEASE bring more of this white powder. I neeeeeed more of it.

_**MORE YETI**_ A pair of [[Yeti]] are right where the other one was... It appears they are looking for something, maybe their lost companion. [[Draxus]] pushes one of them off the cliff, but is then immediately attacked by the other [[Yeti]]. The [[Yeti]] looks at [[Draxus]] with a [[Chilling Gaze]] and paralyzes [[Draxus]] temporarily, before striking him. [[Draxus]] is somehow _not_ downed. _**COMBAT**_ We stun and blind the creature, then knocked prone. We fuck it the fuck up. _**COMBAT OVER**_
