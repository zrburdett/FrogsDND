# Frogs Campaign S1E32
## **Dal Glug's Awakening**
*< [[Frogs Campaign S1E31]] | [[Frogs Campaign S1E33]] >*

### Session Summary
After arriving at [[Eroll Cove]], we notice that it's a lot busier than we remember. There's a similar amount of people to when we were last leaving [[Osplett's Gate]]. We head onto shore and start looking around for shops to restock on supplies.

While doing so, [[Draxus]] checks in with some people at the port to see what the deal is. A motherly looking woman explains that there has been a rather large political change in [[Eroglyf]]. The [[Counsel of Masters]] are no longer in charge of the city and some kind of ghost from the dead has taken control.

[[Virahck]] and [[Glacialmaw]] stock up on rations at [[The Adventurer's Outpost]], also purchasing a small belt pouch. They then head to [[Gemison's Gems]] for powdered silver.

[[Palu]] and [[Kothvush]] head to a woodworking shop and inquire about some magical items they have - [[Palu]] eventually purchases the [[Staff of the Bird Call]].

[[Virahck]] and [[Glacialmaw]] go to [[Miguel's Magic Emporium]] and buy some magic repairing bottles before making their way to the sailing school to purchase a purple dinghy.

### Log
We arrive at [[Eroll Cove]]. The harbor is a lot busier since we've been here last. There are big crowds going to and from the ships. It seems just as busy as [[Osplett's Gate]] was when we were there.

- [x] We need to get some [[Navigator's Tools]] so we can better navigate while on [[Lightning McQueen]].

[[Virahck]] can go with [[Brewster]] to gather more rations. [[Draxus]] wants to figure out what is happening on [[Tapu Ero]].

We eventually get on the ferry to head on into [[Eroll Cove]]. We decide that we might need another dinghy. [[Palu]] is perhaps interested in speaking with the blacksmith, but doesn't really need to.

[[Ebu Tart]] and [[Urgon Walfa]] are going to stay with the ship.

There are a lot of laborers at the port working - we see plenty of workers and also common folk loading into the ships.

[[Draxus]] starts checking in with people walking by at the port:

>[!quote] Some random mother
>Oh, well, everybody in my family and my friends told me we need to leave the island. There has been a big change in [[Eroglyf]]. The [[Counsel of Masters]] are no longer in charge of the city. Some ghost from the dead has taken control of the city. We can't stay here anymore. They say this is going to be the next city to be ransacked.

[[Draxus]] gets the impression that a lot of people are leaving...

[[Virahck]] and [[Glacialmaw]] head off to resupply on rations, eventually finding [[The Adventurer's Outpost]]. 5 silver per one day of rations per person. [[Glacialmaw]] asks about powdered silver, but he doesn't have any and directs him to a gem shop or arcane shop. [[Glacialmaw]] purchases a small belt pouch.

([[Shadow of the Knife]] HQ is in the [[Andees]])

[[Glacialmaw]] makes his way to [[Gemison's Gems]], run by [[Jim Gemison]]. Glacialmaw asks about powdered silver and Jim points to the corner. [[Glacialmaw]] purchases 3 bags of silver powder. [[Jim Gemison]] asks about [[Virahck]]'s [[Armor of Gleaming]] and why there are so many missing gems.

[[Palu]] and [[Kothvush]] think about looking around for a magic shop, but [[Palu]] instead tries to ask a hot young man. He isn't... traditionally hot, but he's the hottest guy she's seen so far. Human wearing an apron standing outside of a restaurant, smoking a cigarette.

>[!quote] Hot(ish) man
>I grew up in town here, yeah. You're not a fan of Miguel? But he's such a friendly guy! You could go to a woodworking shop that sells magic wands and staffs and things. There's an antique shop too that sells magic items. Miguel's is really the place to go, unless you want to go to a alchemist.

##### Woodworking shop
Human male is behind the counter. We ask about his magical items for sale. The guy working the shop is just an apprentice. The true master passed away a few years ago, but we have wants, staffs, carpentry tools, etc. Also hold classes once per week. If you pay for a month of classes, you get four!

He pulls out a wand and waves it at [[Kothvush]] - all the muscles on his face tighten and he is stuck in a smile. This wand will force anyone to smile for at least one minute! Also have a frown wand too...

[[Wand of Pyrotechnics]] and some other rare wands, too. [[Wand of Viscid Globs]].

He pulls out a large staff and when he taps it on the ground, you hear the song of a bird. He taps it again and you hear it from another corner of the shop - use it 10 times per day. [[Staff of the Bird Call]]. [[Palu]] is wide-eyed and loves it. Palu offers 59 gold. It's like 7 feet tall. He purchases it.

##### Miguel's
[[Glacialmaw]] makes his way to [[Miguel's Magic Emporium]]. He purchases a bottle sling, but the bottle repairs itself.

##### Sailing School
[[Virahck]] and [[Glacialmaw]] heads to his sailing school and ask about [[Navigator's Tools]] and a new dinghy. They purchase. [[Glacialmaw]] buys a few slings and a medium sized pouch. [[Virahck]] buys a purple dinghy.

##### Back to the boat
[[Virahck]] struggles a little bit but we eventually make it back to [[Lightning McQueen]]. We chat about our purchases. It is early evening.

We head to sleep. Nothing much happens.

##### Set sail!
