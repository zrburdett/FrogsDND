### Session Summary
After exiting the crumbling [[Prying Pumpkin]] building, [[Draxus]], [[Virahck]], and [[Kothvush]] regroup and reassess the situation. [[Virahck]] mentions that the guy we just fought was [[Hubert Pumpkinpatch]], which catches [[Kothvush]] by surprise considering he didn't recognize him before. The three of them are concerned that the the vampires are going to overrun the entirety of [[Yidi]] or even further, just like they did on [[Tapu Ero]]. We decide that our next step is to find the rest of the party so we can get off this island and start focusing our attention on releasing [[The Beast]]. We head to the Circle to see if we can find anybody.

Meanwhile, [[Glacialmaw]] is still in the [[Church of Abertai]] assisting the clerics. He prays for [[Abertai]]'s guidance and a sliver of light brightens the room from the stained glass above him, but quickly dissipates. [[Glacialmaw]] speaks with one of the clergy and is told that he shouldn't open any of the front doors, but if he wants to leave, then there's a window in the back area that he could open and jump onto the street from - he does so and finds himself looking at the dire scene of the massive red pyramid in the sky and many bodies of civilians, guards, and vampires on the ground. As he makes it to the Circle, he encounters a small group of guards fighting off a small group of vampire spawn - he steps in to assist!

As they continue to fight, [[Draxus]], [[Virahck]], and [[Kothvush]] turn the corner and see [[Glacialmaw]] engaged in a brawl with the vampire spawn. They rush in and help to keep them at bay. Unfortunately, the vampire spawn are extremely strong and it takes almost all of the party's strength to survive, especially considering three of them were just facing one of their toughest opponents yet. All of the party but [[Draxus]] go unconscious, but luckily the two remaining vampire spawn were turned away and have quite a distance to make up to get back into the fight, so [[Draxus]] rips off a healing potion patch and two mastiff patches from [[Kothvush]]'s [[Robe of Useful Items]] and is able to revive [[Kothvush]] so the two of them can make a safe exit from the Circle.

They make their way to the [[Hotel D'Lemaer]] and [[Kothvush]] bangs on the door, pleading to whoever may be listening that they need shelter or else they will almost certainly die. A red-headed elf answers the door and quickly shuffles them inside before slamming the door shut and barricading it once again. She tells the party that the hotel is mostly empty, but there are a handful of people sheltering in the upper floors. We remain on the first floor in one of the back rooms so we can rest until [[Virahck]] and [[Glacialmaw]] can regain consciousness. Once everybody is feeling a bit more stable, we decide that we need to immediately inform [[Urgon Walfa]] of what has happened and that we need to get out of the [[Andees]] as soon as possible so that we can awaken [[The Beast]] and defeat [[Dal Glug]].

Meanwhile in jail, [[Palu]] has been contemplating her situation and considering her options as she hears a fellow inmate singing in a nearby cell. As if a lightbulb flashes with electricity, she picks up the piss bucket in the corner of her cell and has a weirdly intrigued look on her face. She casts Piss Knife a few times using the liquid in the bucket and is able to successfully shatter the bolt of the lock on her cell door, but she cuts herself ever so slightly on some iced piss. She pushes on the door and it swings open...

### Log
We are very concerned that [[Yi]] is going to be overrun by vampires just like [[Eroll Cove]]. [[Draxus]] and [[Virahck]] head out of the destroyed [[Prying Pumpkin]] and they start to look for [[Kothvush]], who is in the alleyway sitting in a pile of trash looking very defeated. They round the corner and see [[Kothvush]]. [[Virahck]] mentions that it was [[Hubert Pumpkinpatch]] that we just fought. [[Kothvush]] is confused because he didn't recognize him. We decide to find the rest of the party so we can move on. As we walk onto the street, we mainly see the empty street. We decide to head towards the Circle to see if we can find anybody.

Meanwhile, [[Glacialmaw]] is still in the [[Church of Abertai]] assisting the clerics. [[Glacialmaw]] prays for [[Abertai]]'s guidance - the stained glass grows slightly brighter and a sliver of light shines down into the church, but quickly vanishes. [[Glacialmaw]] inquires about leaving the church. They reply that it's probably best not to leave the church, but the door behind the altar, following the hallway and up the stairs, there's a window that you could jump out of, I guess?

[[Glacialmaw]] sees people running north along the edge of Central. He hops out of the window and takes a look at the pyramid in the sky. There's a red tint in the color of the pyramid and it's probably 1,000 feet in the air, roughly. [[Glacialmaw]] heads to the Circle to get a better idea of what to do. As he approaches the Circle, he sees four vampires across from him at the southern end of the Circle. There's a significant pile of bodies of guards, civilians, and vampire spawn. [[Glacialmaw]] attacks! He summons another Old Man of the Woods.

[[Draxus]], [[Virahck]], and [[Kothvush]] are approaching the Circle. We see a number of dead bodies and we see some other vampires heading south, away from us. We continue north and see [[Glacialmaw]] fighting some vampire spawn. We help!

***COMBAT***

We struggle very much against these four vampire spawn. We all go unconscious except for [[Draxus]], who is able to to stabilize [[Glacialmaw]] and put [[Virahck]] and [[Glacialmaw]] into a cart, but struggles to lift [[Kothvush]] into the cart. [[Draxus]] rips off three patches: one healing potion that is fed to [[Kothvush]] and two mastiffs which stand guard. [[Kothvush]] grabs the cart and dashes away with it, further from the two remaining vampire spawn.

We run down the street directly towards the [[Hotel D'Lemaer]], hoping to get in for some shelter. The building itself is still standing, but the front doors are shut. It's a very beautiful building. [[Kothvush]] (rolls a [[Natural 20]]) and persuades a small elf on the other side of the door to open the building. There's a large main hall with two twin staircases winding up the sides, a large chandelier still lit with many candles, a small desk at the back of the room, a red-headed elf woman. We ditch the cart outside and we drag our unconscious friends inside. She explains that there are very few people left inside but many are hiding in the upper floors. Breakfast is complementary. She suggests that we hide in one of the back rooms of the first floor until [[Glacialmaw]] and [[Virahck]] wake up. We spend about 4 hours getting everybody to a good condition and then decide that we need to alert [[Urgon Walfa]] and the [[Shadow of the Knife]] what is happening.

Meanwhile, [[Palu]] is still stuck in jail and can hear somebody singing in a nearby cell while she considers her options. She picks up the piss bucket in the corner of her cell and brings her piss over to the door, casting Piss Knife on the lock. The Piss Knife explodes and creates a crack by the locking mechanism. She casts Piss Knife again - the bolt in the lock shatters, but she cuts herself in the face with some iced piss. She pulls on the door and it swings open.
