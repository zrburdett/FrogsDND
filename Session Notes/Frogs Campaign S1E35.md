### Session Summary
After collecting our goodies from [[Sunurah]] the Lord of the Fishies, the party continues sailing south towards the [[Andees]]. After a few days, we come upon a massive storm in the distance. We can see a ship ahead of us going into the storm and see strange shapes envelop the ship, lifting it up into the air and slamming it down on the surface, causing it to snap and break apart.

[[Virahck]] attempts to steer clear of the storm, but it's pull is too great and we find ourselves sailing straight into the dark and rainy storm. As we continue, the ship gets harder and harder to control until we see twisting cyclones touch town around us as two air elementals take form and begin attacking the party. "SINK, SINK, SINK, SINK!" they cry in primordial.

We struggle for a bit, but [[Urgon Walfa]] enlarges [[Kothvush]] to double his size, [[Glacialmaw]] uses the [[Sherman Mushroom Charm]] and conjures the old man of the woods mushroom to help fight, and [[Ebu Tart]] gives us all the ability to walk on water for an hour, helping us destroy the elementals.

As the sky begins to clear, we head for the mostly destroyed ship that we saw enter the storm before us. In the wreckage, we find twenty refugees that are headed to the [[Andees]] from the [[Wishbones]]. [[Draxus]] nearly kills one of them, but [[Virahck]] steps in and saves him from the clutches of death - we opt to use the ladder from now on.

Despite not having any food left, we continue to sail until we reach the [[Andees]]. We drop off the refugees on [[Lyniys]] and continue to sail our way to [[Scaramar]], where we intend to meet up with the [[Shadow of the Knife]].

### Log
The egg we had on [[Lightning McQueen]] is a black dragon egg.

Loot from the haul:
- 16 greater healing potions that look muddy brown from the potion rack
- Demonic Egg to consume on a full moon
- Egg holder
- Sakhalin Sturgeon
- Smalltooth Sawfish
- Tequila Splitfin
- Ornate Sleeper Ray
- Devil's Hole Pupfish
- Eel
- Bulette corpse

[[Sunurah]] takes our gem and goes on his merry way, as do we.

Another two days of sailing pass and, during the mid afternoon, we spot a ship in the distance. They appear to be sailing in the same direction. There is a dark storm cloud coming towards us. The ship meets the edge of the storm and we see a strange shape envelop the ship. The wind is getting faster and faster, but we attempt to go around the storm, but it doesn't get us very far away. It starts to rain and it gets darker around us. We can barely see the other ship now. The shape in the clouds is becoming distinctly humanoid. It's essentially wrapping itself around the ship. We brace for the storm. We see the ship almost lift off of the surface of the water and see the main mast snap in half when it hits the water.

We are in the storm now and it's very difficult to control the ship. The wind around our ship shifts and we see a vague humanoid form appear and disappear. [[Glacialmaw]] speaks to it in [[Primordial]], but only an intensification follows.

Twisting cyclones reach down from the sky and touch down around the ship. [[Palu]] and [[Kothvush]] hold on tight, but the others are blown up by the intense winds. [[Virahck]] grabs onto a beam, but [[Glacialmaw]] and [[Draxus]] get carried even higher until they are dropped from high above. [[Glacialmaw]] into the water, but [[Draxus]] hits the boat on his way down. The cyclones morph together into another humanoid figure and the two figures float above the water on either side of our ship. [[Glacialmaw]] makes his way back onto the boat, hanging onto the ladder on the side of the boat.

**COMBAT WITH TWO AIR ELEMENTALS**

The elementals scream, "SINK, SINK, SINK, SINK!"

The elemental wraps its limbs around the ship and slams down on the ship.

[[Glacialmaw]] conjures the old man of the woods with his [[Sherman Mushroom Charm]].

One of the elementals dives down below into our ship, [[Ebu Tart]] and [[Urgon Walfa]] scream.

[[Urgon Walfa]] enlarges [[Kothvush]], doubling his size, weight x 8, and giving advantage on saving throws, with an extra d4 on attacks.

We eventually destroy them both and the storm slowly fades away. We can see the ship we were following earlier, but it's looking pretty destroyed. We see bodies in the water. We swing the boat over to investigate the wreckage. There are 20 people hanging on that are still alive. We approach and they plead for their lives. They are headed to the [[Andees]]. [[Draxus]] lightning lures one of them out of the water - the first one is DOA. "That was someone's father!" "My father! Noooo!!!" The son sobs over his corpse. [[Glacialmaw]] touches the man and a little bit of color returns to his body, but he doesn't wake up until [[Virahck]] uses a spell.

All 20 people come up onto the ship and tell us we are 2 or 3 days from the [[Andees]]. They were coming from the [[Wishbones]], passage from [[Sorflow]]. We set sail for several days until, on the third day, we hear a buzzing sound from all around us. It's different than the elementals, but we aren't sure what is making the noise. We look up into the sky and see a torpedo shaped balloon carrying a large wooden barge, heading south. We see land in the distance! We have never seen such an aircraft and are all amazed.

Several sets of eyes are watching us from under the ship, "Please don't make us slaves! Just leave us on the nearest land!" We agree to drop them at the nearest beach. We make them jump off the side to swim to land.

We drop off the refugees and make our way to [[Scaramar]]. [[Urgon Walfa]] takes a look at our map and complains that nothing is labeled on these islands. He begins to write down on our map.

[[Scaramar]] is controlled by the [[Shadow of the Knife]], there are no other settlements there.

We make our way to the island of [[Scaramar]] and arrive on the island's dock.
