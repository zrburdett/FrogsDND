### Session Summary
The party at the [[Red Clam]] is winding down now but [[Palu]] starts getting antsy after having such a sustenant dream from [[Draxus]] not too long ago. She looks around the bar for somebody who might have some good dreams but ends up approaching a man that she noticed was likely selling some type of drugs. The drug dealer, [[Bartholomew]], only has small amounts of the okay stuff, but points [[Palu]] to room 311 to speak to his boss.

In room 311, [[Palu]] meets [[Ralaad]], who speaks about different drugs that he has access to and other information about making money at sea or any other secrets to help her tendencies to harvest dreams.

[[Ralaad]] offers [[Palu]] [[Blue Sand]], a powdery blue substance that enhances perception, athletics, acrobatics, and raises wisdom temporarily when snorted, and [[Dreamflakes]], thinly sliced psychedelic bark that causes extremely long and vivid dreams when smoked and visuals when chewed. [[Palu]] purchases some [[Dreamflakes]] and further learns that [[Ralaad]] is a part of an organization that has a base in the [[Andees]] in the [[Cerulean Temple]] in the twin cities.

[[Palu]], while relatively drunk still, makes her way back to [[Lightning McQueen]] before spilling the beans at the fact that she just bought some psychedelics but also that she is now part dhampir and she occasionally consumes the dreams of both the party and other random people that she interacts with ever since [[Dal Glug]] bit her in the [[Red Pyramid]].

[[Kothvush]] immediately freaks out due to the immense invasion of privacy and raises his voice at [[Palu]], while displaying immense feelings of betrayal, anger, and disgust. [[Palu]] responds by viciously mocking the dreams that she had taken from [[Kothvush]], pointing out his loss of family and the disconnectedness that he feels as a result of his past. The two yell for a while and others, such as [[Draxus]], who seems confused as to why this is such a big deal due to him only recently having experienced sleeping and dreaming for the first time, give the two some space to hash it out.

Tempers eventually calm and the party inevitably rests for the evening.

Upon waking, we set sail for the [[Andees]] before being approached by a an old man captaining a magic sandy island through the ocean. He identifies himself as [[Sunurah]], the Lord of the Fishes, and promptly begins selling us some of his exotic fish and rare wares.

[[Draxus]] eventually offers one of the magic beans by planting it in Doctor Lord's island - the bean sprouts into a hungry Bulette, prompting a short battle involving demons and the near-drowning of [[Draxus]]. After things have settled from the short skirmish, we buy most of what [[Sunurah]] has to offer, including a few types of exotic fish, 16 murky brown health potions, and a [[Demonic Egg]].

### Log
#### Red Clam
[[Palu]] yells over to us that she wants to stay by the [[Red Clam]] for the evening and potentially snag some dreams overnight instead of returning to the party on [[Lightning McQueen]].

[[Palu]] starts looking around for someone to consume the dreams of - someone who might be drinking too heavily that would be an easy target. She's getting lots of attention as there likely aren't many Tieflings around here. Some suggest not to go near [[Eroglyf]] as it's gotten much more dangerous recently. They tell of someone stooped over a body in [[Eroll Cove]] doing something nefarious. Most people are headed to the [[Andees]], some to [[Yogurv Bay]], some to [[Orcida]] - various traders, sailors, etc.

[[Palu]] spots someone trading small pouches of money for little baggies of something. [[Roth Sag]] eventually announces last call. It doesn't seem like many people are staying aboard and more heading back to their own boats.

[[Palu]] starts talking to the drug dealer. 1 gold for a dime bag. If you want something better, you'll have to talk to my associate in room 311 - knock four times.

[[Palu]] makes her way to room 311 before she knocks four times. She enters. It's a small room with a double bed, small armchair, with a man sitting, another guy standing. It seems like they've been talking for a while. [[Bartholomew]] was the one on the decks apparently. [[Palu]] starts complaining about the prices and asking for something stronger. She wants to heighten her mind and put people to sleep. The man describes [[Blue Sand]] and shows a blue powdery substance. You have to snort this - it enhances your perception, athletics, acrobatics, and raises the wisdom of you mind. Don't use it too much. Can't use too many doses or the effects will become counteracted. [[Palu]] asks for something else. [[Dreamflakes]] - looks like thinly sliced bark in a bag. You can put this in your mouth and suck and chew for visuals, smoke it to enter an extremely long and vivid dream. Use too much and your mouth will become black. Single dreamflake is 15 gold.

[[Palu]] now starts asking for information on making money. He's not one to exchange secrets to a fresh face, but if she asks him a question, maybe he'll answer. [[Palu]] purchases 5 [[Dreamflakes]] for 50 gold. He's involved in a certain organization in the [[Andees]] - look for the [[Cerulean Temple]] in the twin cities. He is [[Ralaad]], friend is [[Femzat]].

[[Palu]] flies over to [[Lightning McQueen]] and tells us of drugs. [[Palu]] tell us she consumes dreams and [[Kothvush]] starts to freak out. [[Palu]] explains the dhampir thing. [[Draxus]] seems confused because he is rather new to dreaming. [[Kothvush]] and [[Palu]] start going at it and [[Kothvush]] is very angry and disappointed at [[Palu]]'s invasion of privacy. [[Palu]] uses [[Kothvush]]'s dream against him and mocks his loss of family and disconnectedness.

#### Back at Sea
We sleep the night and sail forward to the [[Andees]]. In the morning, we hear a loud buzzing noise behind us, getting louder and louder. [[Draxus]] looks behind us and sees a pile of sand approaching us at a high rate of speed. It looks like an island with a palm tree is coming towards us.

The noise gets louder and louder and the island is approaching quickly. The island comes up right next to our boat and matches our speed - a man in his 50s with a long gray dirty beard raises his voice "Ahoe!"

Tattered red and white picnic blanket with various trinkets and a pile of money - like 500 gold. We're all very confused. [[Sunurah]] the Lord of the Fishies - this is a traveling island and I am a traveling salesman. There are a lot of dead fishies on the island too.

There's a potion rack as well with dirty brown sludge, and some hardboiled egg looking cups - he found it on the deck of a sinking ship. He calls it a [[Demonic Egg]] - it's best to consume them on a full moon. 100 gold.

[[Draxus]] asks about the potions - apparently high quality healing potions. All of them, 16 of them, for 400 gold. He also has extremely rare fish:
- Sakala sturgeon - only available in the northern sea
- Smalltooth sawfish - can use this as a handsaw!
- Tequila spitfin - spits tequila!

All the fish for another 400 gold.

We ask how to hatch the dragon egg. The island and [[Sunurah]] aren't exactly separate entities. [[Draxus]] offers a bean and plants a bean on his island. A hungry Bulette burrows up from the sand and attacks [[Draxus]].

[[Draxus]] kills a rat from his rat hat and summons demons (two quasits) onto the island to deal with the Bulette.

[[Draxus]] and [[Palu]] are off the boat and island and we're moving quickly away from them. [[Kothvush]] attempts to stop the boat while [[Glacialmaw]] tells [[Sunurah]] to save the drowning party members. [[Sunurah]] folds up his island and it wraps up into a bindle on the end of his stick. We eventually make our way back to [[Palu]] and [[Draxus]] to pull them aboard.

(It's actually Doctor Lord of the Fishies)

We continue sailing to the [[Andees]] while the beast hopefully suffocates in the bindle. [[Sunurah]] whips out a set of dice for [[Liar's Dice]]. [[Virahck]] screws up his count on [[Liar's Dice]].

We wait an hour or two before opening up the island - no indication that the Bulette is still alive.
