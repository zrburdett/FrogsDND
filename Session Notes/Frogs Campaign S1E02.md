### Last time


### Session Summary


### Log
**Long story short:** We get captured and thrown in a cell. Eventually we escape the cell and break out some other inmates including [[Hubert Pumpkinpatch]], [[Germ Knot]], and [[Dana]]. A group of 10 kobolds were also broken out but decided to band together and escape without us. 

**SECRET ROOM**
**Description:** Biig hole, very dark. There are two chests on the other side of the room, with an arrow trap in between.
**Loot:**
[[Palu]] - 2 healing potions, one given to [[Kothvush]] for immediate consumption 
[[Virahck]] - Mysterious blue potion 

**NINE MORE CELLS**
**Description:**
- Ice troll ([[Glacialmaw]])
- Half elf ([[Azurak]])
- Gnome ([[Klept]])

We break the doors and free the captured souls, who join the party.
We search the cells and find some trash but leave it behind. 

**THREE PODIUM ROOM**
**Description:** Each podium (1.5' in diameter, 3-4' tall) has a panel with a corresponding door behind it.

The panels appear to have buttons on them but nothing happens when they're pushed.
There is a lock on all the doors with several bolts.
When standing on top, all the buttons depress. We stand on all 3 podiums and...
We hear some bolts unlock.

When [[Kothvush]] gets off the podium, the locks appear to reengage.

**LEFT DOOR**
[[Virahck]] opens the door and there's a bunch of rocks, we grab them and place them on the podiums which keep the doors unlocked.

**MIDDLE DOOR**
[[Virahck]] opens the door and there's a big hole.
[[Palu]] brings the humans into the chasm room and attempts to convince [[Hubert Pumpkinpatch]] to get across the 10 foot gap - he's about it.
[[Hubert Pumpkinpatch]] (with a rope tied around his waist) gets tossed by [[Glacialmaw]] and he makes it across. He says there's an additional 10 foot gap in front of him, but decides to jump across anyways.
[[Glacialmaw]] is holding onto the rope too tightly when Hubert jumps and Hubert falls slightly into the hole, before getting pulled back up a bit.
[[Glacialmaw]] gives Hubert a little bit of slack so he's able to jump across the second gap - and he does successfully.
Hubert yells back that there's a chest - he opens the chest and pockets the goods.
Hubert jumps in the air while [[Glacialmaw]] yanks the rope hard, but he makes it back without too much damage.
[[Hubert Pumpkinpatch]] reports back that he finds a health potion and apparently found his gear. 

**RIGHT DOOR**
[[Azurak]] opens the door and [[Germ Knot]] follows. There is a grid of ~minecraft~ pressure plates on the floor that go 25 feet ahead of us.
[[Klept]] is thrown across the room and manages to make it over all the pressure plates.
[[Glacialmaw]] brings a rock into the pressure plate room.
[[Klept]] sees a lever on the wall, slightly obstructed by some vines, and a closed door.
[[Kothvush]] looks at the wall above the pressure plates, but it appears to be solid rock.
[[Klept]] flips the lever but doesn't notice any change.
[[Glacialmaw]] tosses [[Hubert Pumpkinpatch]] onto one of the pressure plates - he lands on his add right in the middle of the plates and is super pissed.
Nothing happens when the pressure plate is depressed, he walks to the other side without incident.
[[Glacialmaw]] rips [[Hubert Pumpkinpatch|Hubert]]'s finger off - who screams in agony and runs out the door, still with the rope tied around him.
[[Palu]] checks all the front pressure plates and nothing happens.
We all pass through the room and go through the door - but [[Azurak]] picks up Hubert's finger as he passes it.

**ROOM**
**Description:** There is an open hallway with stairs on the other side.

[[Azurak]] grabs [[Germ Knot|Germ]]'s ass, who doesn't really react.
[[Virahck]] peers into the room and sees more grimlocks! 

**COMBAT**
Grimlock #1 - trashed by punches ([[Kothvush]]) and a killed by missile ([[Azurak]])
Grimlock #2 - injured by magic missile ([[Palu]]) and bitten to death ([[Mo]])
Grimlock #3 - gets truly fucked up by psychic damage ([[Azurak]])

[[Azurak]] sings a song but nobody really feels alright about it.
[[Klept]] tries to run out of the room but doesn't quite make it.
[[Glacialmaw]] throws a rock at the ceiling near one of the monsters - some stone falls on top of a grimlock and takes 4pts damage.
[[Azurak]] sings some type of death song to a grimlock, who dies via psychic damage.
[[Klept]] runs away further.
Grimlock swings and hits Virahck for 16pts of damage - who goes unconscious.
Grimlock swings and hits Kothvush for 9pts of damage - who goes unconscious.
[[Palu]] casts magic missile and kills one grimlock and injures another.
[[Mo]], as a wolf, bites the last remaining grimlock and kills it.

[[Virahck]] gets healed a bit.
[[Mo]] returns to human form and heals Kothvush.
**COMBAT OVER** 

**ROOM**
[[Mo]] is still naked when he transforms back into a wolf, so he runs back while everyone else puts on their clothing and equipment after we kill the grimlocks.
We decide to rest here for a while. 

**LONG REST**
[[Glacialmaw]] takes first shift - nothing happens.
[[Klept]] takes second shift - nothing happens.
[[Mo]] takes third shift - nothing happens.
**LONG REST ENDS** 

**PRISON ISLE**
**Description:**
- [[Path]] going towards the docks
- Shack in the distance, probably a path that goes to it

We exit the door and are out in the open.
