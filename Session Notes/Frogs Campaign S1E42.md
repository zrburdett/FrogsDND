### Session Summary
[[Kothvush]] and [[Virahck]] see each other in all the commotion and decide to make their way towards the [[Prying Pumpkin]] to find the rest of the party while [[Draxus]] simultaneously does the same. [[Draxus]] makes it there first and proceeds to plant another one of the [[Magic Beans]] into the ground, causing yet another pyramid to grow and emerge from the ground, expanding to a 60 square foot base pushing up 30 feet in the air, destroying the side of the [[Prying Pumpkin]] building in the process.

[[Draxus]] whispers to the [[Demogorgon]] - though unsettling, he gets the feeling that he's doing the right thing, so he moves towards the door of the swelling pyramid and casts Dancing Lights so that he's able to see as he descends into the depths of the new pyramid alone.

[[Palu]] continues to remain trapped in her jail cell, eventually speaking to a plump and bald man who yells at her to keep quiet. She pleads with him that she's a high level magic user and that she can help save the city, but he is unamused and spits in her face after saying, "Cast this!" [[Palu]] attempts to distract the guard with Mage Hand, but he seems unphased as he walks away. The spectral hand fails to maintain a hold of the keys, but struggles to do so and [[Palu]] is left alone in her cell.

As they round the corner, [[Virahck]] and [[Kothvush]] see a mysterious pyramid on the side of the [[Prying Pumpkin]] that wasn't there before. They take another route as their path is blocked and then get closer to the pyramid to get another look.

Meanwhile, [[Draxus]] is descending further into the pyramid and eventually enters a chamber that holds a lifted stone block with a golden sarcophagus on top, several chests, some tapestries, and a large wooden ship wheel. He tries to spin the wheel with an [[Eldritch Blast]] - the blast hits one of the pegs and the ensure pyramid begins to shift as the wheel turns slightly. Another [[Eldritch Blast]] hits the toe of the sarcophagus, revealing the feet of a mummified humanoid. He quickly searches the chests, gathering some useful loot, and then glances over at the sarcophagus just in time to see the toes of the corpse begin to curl. [[Draxus]], not wanting any part of what may happen, runs back up the stairs.

While this is happening, [[Glacialmaw]] remains in the [[Church of Abertai]], speaking with the bishops and praying to [[Abertai]] - he feels stronger and gains [[Abertai]]'s Blessing (+1 to AC and saving throws).

As [[Virahck]] and [[Kothvush]] round the corner to get a better look at the pyramid, they look at the [[Prying Pumpkin]] where the wall had been destroyed by the pyramid and see a handsome blond man digging through some of the artifacts on the fourth floor. It looks like he's sorting through some spellcasting components so [[Virahck]] calls out to him after getting on the pyramid, but loses his footing and falls off the side. [[Kothvush]] scales the side of the pyramid and calls out to the man as well before jumping towards him. He lands on the fourth floor, but the floor boards give way and cause him to fall into the third floor's room with all of the orbs. [[Kothvush]] quickly peruses the shelves and pockets one as [[Draxus]] and [[Virahck]] make their way into the crumbling building to hopefully catch the blond man as he tries to run away. The three of them meet up inside and make their way to the top of the building towards the big man's office.

The blond man is leaning over his desk appearing to arrange some items on his desk. We confront him and [[Draxus]] tells him that their deal is done with. The blond man cracks a smile and begins muttering under his breath, whispering an incantation as he starts to disappear. [[Draxus]] quickly casts counterspell and causes the spell to fizzle out as the man's face turns to anger.

We begin the fight of our lives, hurling everything we've got at the man while he enacts a vicious assault, spawning delusions, provoking unprompted actions, but [[Draxus]] is able to lock him over the desk and out of concentration. The man responds by shooting out jets of cold air at the three of us, dealing massive. The fight continues and everybody gets more and more injured until [[Kothvush]] attempts to grab hold of him in an effort to push the two of them out of the window, but his hands slip and he tumbles through the glass alone, falling into the alleyway. As [[Kothvush]] regains his composure and looks up at where he fell, he sees the man go out of the window as well, but he instead begins flying away into the distance.

[[Virahck]] and [[Draxus]] manage to escape the crumbling building just as the pyramid shifts again and destroys the [[Prying Pumpkin]] even more.

### Log
There are about 15-20 vampires that landed from the red pyramid.

[[Virahck]] sees two different groups of vampires moving in different directions - one group (between 6 to 10 spawn) heading west and another group (6-10) heading south.

[[Kothvush]] notices [[Virahck]] and heads over to chat during all the commotion and decide to try and find the rest of the group around the [[Prying Pumpkin]]. [[Draxus]] heads towards the [[Prying Pumpkin]] as well. He heads into the front area and proceeds to plant another one of the [[Magic Beans]]. A pyramid with a 60 square foot base explodes out of the ground and pushes itself up 30 feet high. [[Draxus]] screams at the building to renege the deal that was made.

He then whispers to the [[Demogorgon]] - though unsettling, he gets the feeling that he is doing the right thing, doing what he should be doing. The pyramid is now rumbling with parts of the [[Prying Pumpkin]] starting to clatter around. The pyramid appears to be swelling, almost. As if the pyramid is growing further in response to the prayer to the [[Demogorgon]]. There's a door in the pyramid! [[Draxus]] reaches for the handle and casts Dancing Lights to see in front of him. As he walks through, he is presented with a staircase...

[[Palu]], meanwhile, is trapped in his jailcell. She runs up the wall and takes a peek through the window, overlooking the water. She pounds on the door, pleading to be let out. A plump bald man comes over and tells her to keep quiet. She tells him that she is a high level spellcaster and would be able to help. "Cast this!" as he spits in her face, "the city guards will deal with this." [[Palu]] casts Mage Hand and fake slaps him. [[Palu]] very clearly has the hand reach towards the keys and pleads with the man further to let her out. The jailer dismisses [[Palu]] and begins walking away, but not before the spectral hand attempts to grab the keys another time - it fails.

[[Virahck]] and [[Kothvush]] see a pyramid in the place where the [[Prying Pumpkin]] used to be. The window booth of the [[Prying Pumpkin]] is fully destroyed and there isn't much room anywhere to move around with the 300 people on Awful Ave. They decide to walk back north and come down a different way to make their way to the other side of the pyramid.

As [[Draxus]] enters the pyramid, the door shuts behind him, sealing him in the pyramid with only his dancing lights. He continues down the staircase, maybe 3 or 4 sets of stairs, entering a chamber with a lifted stone block with a golden sarcophagus lying on top. There are several chests, multiple tapestries, and a large wooden ship wheel. He tries to spin the wheel with an [[Eldritch Blast]] - one hits the steering wheel, snapping one of the handles but the wheel spins. He hears a loud crunching noise as the pyramid shifts to the side. ([[Kothvush]] and [[Virahck]] also see some movement of the pyramid and hear clattering around it) The other [[Eldritch Blast]] hits the toe of the sarcophagus. [[Draxus]] looks inside the chests and finds:
- Several carved stone busts, relatively small - one looks like Halfling [[Draxus]] and another looks like [[Drow]] [[Draxus]], another like the child that was previously in the alley
- 350 gold
- Potion of Greater Healing
- Scroll of a Fourth Level Spell - fill in the blank
- Burlap bag

[[Draxus]] takes a closer look at the sarcophagus and sees the toes of the body inside curl a bit. He opens his eyes wide and starts to walk back up the stairs.

Much of the Circle has cleared at this point and [[Glacialmaw]] helps the bishops push the peasants away from the doors and they close them to keep the [[Church of Abertai]] safe. [[Glacialmaw]] introduces himself with his real name and the bishops ask if the people at the [[Prying Pumpkin]] have been looking for him. They caution him to keep quiet about his identity. [[Glacialmaw]] feels a blessing fill his body and he feels stronger than before ([[Abertai]]'s Blessing: +1 to AC and saving throws).

[[Virahck]] and [[Kothvush]] turn the corner and see the pyramid slowly moving in it's position. A pile of people have been crushed by it and then one of the walls fall on the side of the [[Prying Pumpkin]]. A handsome blond man can be seen on the fourth floor. We contemplate going inside but then [[Virahck]] climbs up the pyramid and points his longbow at the man in the [[Prying Pumpkin]] asking what he's doing. While he's climbing, he falls off the side. [[Kothvush]] climbs up and peers over to the man - about 15-20 feet away from the room. There's a ton of different types of materials around in boxes in the room. There's a lot of variety - perhaps spellcasting components. He grabs a small wooden box and he hops down from the stool. [[Kothvush]] runs up the side of the pyramid a bit more and tries to jump over to the fourth floor to chase the man...

[[Draxus]] starts walking up the stairs with the dancing lights guiding his way. He exists the pyramid and sees [[Virahck]], who starts freaking out at [[Draxus]]' lack of hands. [[Draxus]] informs [[Virahck]] of the pyramid. Meanwhile, the pyramid shifts more and takes out another bit of the building. [[Kothvush]] makes the jump to the fourth floor, but the wooden planks snap beneath him, causing him to crash down through the floor onto the third floor. [[Virahck]] takes some damage and gets a black eye from more shifting of the pyramid. [[Draxus]] and [[Virahck]] start running around the building, attempting to run towards the big man's office.

[[Kothvush]] crashed into the third floor and looks around the room. It's the orb room. There's a pale blue orb like an ocean and shoves it in the bag. As he opens the door, the pyramid shifts and takes out more of the wall. There's a ton of noise happening but there is heavy footsteps coming from down the hallway. [[Kothvush]] runs into [[Draxus]] and [[Virahck]] but don't pass the blond man. They all head further up the stairs. The building is struggling to hold itself up now. We arrive at the sixth floor and see the door to the biggest office wide open with the blond man leaning over his desk, seemingly doing something with his hands. The man looks familiar to [[Kothvush]], but he can't place it.

[[Draxus]] approaches him and they start talking about their deal again. The man picks up a handful of what he was working on, whispers an incantation, and starts to disappear. [[Draxus]] casts counter spell - and the spell fizzles out. [[Draxus]] attacks him with his axe, but misses both times.

***COMBAT***

We feel a vicious assault, spawning delusions and provoking unprompted actions. [[Draxus]] is able to knock him over the desk and out of concentration. [[Hubert Pumpkinpatch]] responds by standing back up and pointing towards [[Draxus]], but dark tentacles spring out of his back and he is unaffected. [[Kothvush]] attacks him and deals a ton of damage. [[Hubert Pumpkinpatch]] reorients himself and shoots out a jet of cold air, dealing massive damage to [[Kothvush]] and [[Draxus]]. Hubert shoots out another jet of air, damaging [[Draxus]] and [[Virahck]]. [[Kothvush]] tries to push the himself and [[Hubert Pumpkinpatch]] out of the window, but Hubert side steps and [[Kothvush]] gets launched out of the window. Something pushes [[Hubert Pumpkinpatch]] out of the window but then starts flying away.

[[Virahck]] and [[Draxus]] start running out of the offices as the building starts to collapse, they sprint down the stairs as fast as they can in an attempt to dodge falling debris. They can see the small pyramid moving around further as the building gets fucked up even more.
