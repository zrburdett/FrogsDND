### Session Summary
After learning about the history of the [[Andees]] from mayor [[Joan McAlleter]], the party makes their way to meet up with [[Draxus]]' new friends at the [[Wandering Water Witch]]. It's essentially a tavern where we learn about the lodging within [[Yi]] during the festival. They suggest that we either make our way to the unromantic [[Fisterfoot Longhouse]] or just go to the south of the [[Yi Edge River]] where we can camp out.

On our way over there, we encounter [[Sir Morris Mind]], the head honcho of the [[Circus of the Mind Arcade]], who tries to get us to come inside and see what games they have that might interest us. After a bit of enticing, he leads us inside to meet our waiter, Jeremy.

Jeremy presents us several different options for games, and while [[Virahck]] and [[Glacialmaw]] are entranced with Pathfinder and Risk, the rest of us meet up with [[Gertrude Galliger]] and [[Warryn the Werewizrat]] for the Circus of the Mind Royale, a fighting game where your consciousness gets transferred into a miniature of yourself and the winner receives 70% of the 5-gold per-person buy-in pot.

Jeremy presents us with the customizable game board and before long, our consciousnesses are transferred into our game pieces and the battle begins.

[[Kothvush]] and [[Gertrude Galliger|Gertrude]] start a scuffle on the high ground, while [[Palu]] attacks [[Warryn the Werewizrat|Warryn]], and [[Draxus]] summons eight Dretches, only to have them immediately turn on him. After a while, [[Kothvush]] defeats [[Gertrude Galliger]], then [[Draxus]] and [[Palu]] defeat [[Warryn the Werewizrat]]. [[Kothvush]] then turns his attention to [[Palu]], and quickly closes the gap between them before [[Kothvush]] defeats [[Palu]]. While [[Draxus]] and [[Kothvush]] begin duking it out, the Dretches get distracted with the fountain and eventually pull out a golden orb, which later hatches into a baby wyrmling. [[Draxus]] eventually gets the better of [[Kothvush]] and then takes his victory lap around the miniature arena on the back of the baby wyrmling before receiving his 18 gold winnings.

After things settle down, we shake hands and head to the south of the river to set up camp and retire for the evening.

### Log
[[Palu]] has a brain blast and remembers that we need to find the [[Keys of the Beast]] to either fight the vampire directly or in some other fashion.

[[Palu]] is trying to join the group, but needs to wait until he completes his full transition to dhampir.

A ship that departed [[Scaramar]] when we previously got there has a warehouse north of [[Yi]].

The [[Shadow of the Knife]]'s goal was to defeat the vampire that killed [[Renwick]]'s family.

Another goal of [[Draxus]] was to return to his previous race as a drow.

We're in the Circle and we have just finished hearing the Mayor speaking.

We don't get the idea that there is any place to stay in the [[Wandering Water Witch]]. It's mostly a bar/tavern type place. We could potentially set up tents on the side of the river maybe, instead of paying for a place to stay.

We enter the [[Wandering Water Witch]] and locate [[Draxus]]' friends at the bar. He inquires what they are doing after this. They respond that they want to hold down the table here - it's the place to be. They'll all staying at different places but they'll be around for another couple hours.

They say camping around the river would be fine in terms of legality, but there are some less than savory individuals that might try some shit. Michael is staying at the [[Fisterfoot Longhouse]]. The longhouse isn't... very romantic, so it's usually the last to fill up.

We decide to head south down Main Street to figure out a place by the river to set up camp.

Chandeliers at the ?place?.

There's a man standing on the front steps at another place, shouting for people to come into the [[Circus of the Mind Arcade]]. Games on discount for the entire festival. [[Draxus]] asks the party if we have time for games, and inquires if body switching back to a drow is a possibility as a prize. There is a game called Roleplay, in which you can pretend to be another person, or Clue - that game has a professor plum, pointing at [[Kothvush]]. We decide to enter after he tells us that they have [[Liar's Dice]].

[[Virahck]] decides not to go inside in favor of finding a place to sleep for the night, but the carnie tries to drag him in, causing a kerfuffle, making them both fall to the ground. We all go inside.

It's rather dark inside, but there are arrows on the ground leading to many games. Each game is one gold. Jeremy, one of our most excellent waiters, will be around to serve you momentarily. [[Sir Morris Mind]], of the circus of the mind.

Jeremy is well over 6 feet tall and sets down waters in front of us. "You all are clearly adventurers. I hear you like Clue, but I presume you might like something more curious and exciting... The Circus of the Mind Royale is something that Sir Morris created himself. Your mind will be shrunk down into a miniature and you can battle amongst your friends. The winner of the battle will win 70% of the pot. There are other players looking to play, and I could match you into their game too. There is no risk of injury, with only your mind moving into the game piece to fight. One cannot be injured in the Royale."

[[Virahck]] and [[Glacialmaw]] decide not to partake but the rest of us will begin crafting our miniatures. [[Gertrude Galliger]] and [[Warryn the Werewizrat]]. They are looking for opponents and will be joining you.

We take a look at the board and are able to arrange the pieces on the board (rocks, platforms, etc.). 

*REMINDER TO TAKE OUT 5 GOLD FOR EVERYONE (who participates)*

[[Kothvush]] and [[Gertrude Galliger]] have a scuffle. [[Draxus]] summons 8 dretches, who promptly attack him, and [[Palu]] deals some damage to [[Warryn the Werewizrat]] before Warryn runs towards [[Draxus]].

The dretches pull something golden out of the fountain. One of the dretches raises the gold orb from the fountain, and the orb begins cracking until [[Draxus]] releases his concentration and the sphere drops to the ground.

[[Kothvush]] defeats [[Gertrude Galliger]] and [[Palu]].

[[Palu]] and [[Draxus]] defeat [[Warryn the Werewizrat]].

The golden orb breaks open and a baby wyrmling hatches in the arena!

[[Draxus]] defeats [[Kothvush]] and is the last man standing!

The dragon takes off into the air, blowing a cone of fire into [[Draxus]]. The dragon beckons him onto his back and flies around the arena on his back and then returns his consciousness to his body.

[[Draxus]] receives 18 gold.

We head to the river, seeing a bunch of tents along the way. We head to the southern side, finding an empty spot before we set up camp and head to bed.
