# Frogs Campaign S1E33
## **Dal Glug's Awakening**

### Session Summary
The party leaves [[Eroll Cove]] and makes their way South towards the [[Andees]]. [[Kothvush]] and [[Virahck]] trade navigating [[Lightning McQueen]] across the seas, with [[Palu]] taking over during the evening.

When we wake up in the morning, we have a bit of a panic as we realize that the wind has died down drastically, leaving us stuck in the middle of the ocean without any fresh water to drink. We calm ourselves and decide to wait it out until the next morning, when [[Glacialmaw]] will be able to prepare a spell to provide us with fresh water to drink.

Before then, however, we all head to bed, except for [[Palu]], who has been itching to chomp on some dreams. She is tempted by both [[Draxus]] and [[Kothvush]], but eventually makes her way over to [[Draxus]], feeding on his dreams:

[[Draxus]] dreams of a dreary moment when he holds his mother's frail body in his arms as she fades from the land of the living. He cries over her lifeless body and the image becomes blurry, eventually fading back to gray, and returning to depict the same scene. After about 10 times, something different happens; this time, [[Draxus]] is wielding his notorious purple axe, swinging at a [[Demogorgon|two-headed and tailed dog beast]].

[[Palu]] breaks down as she processes the dream and then feels a stinging sensation just below her armpit. [[Kothvush]] takes a look later in the day and, while expertly steering [[Lightning McQueen]], suggests that the patch of skin looks like the skin of a corpse.

We eventually pass by a boat filled with what we identify as refugees hailing from [[Sorflow]] headed towards [[Yi]] in [[Yidi]], but we decide *not* to murder them and commandeer their ship.

Further away, we eventually come upon the [[Red Clam]], a buoyant bar and brothel barge owned by [[Roth Sag]], filled with a a diverse crowd of happy people enjoying their day, partying away. Most of us are rather disinterested, but [[Palu]] has the time of her life with her new friends and acquaintances.

[[Palu]] notices a massive wave approaching the [[Red Clam]], but as people topple over the edge of the barge, laughter erupts and the drunk fucks just roll themselves back to their floating festivities.

### Log
As a reminder, the docks were rather populated and ships are coming and going frequently.

We decide to head south towards the [[Andees]]. [[Kothvush]] navigates [[Lightning McQueen]] south somewhat successfully. A few ships are going towards this direction as well - they're probably also heading to the same place. We sail for hours and eventually it becomes nighttime. [[Palu]] takes control while some of us get some rest.

When we wake up in the morning, we notice that the wind has slowed significantly and the water is calm. We find ourselves at a complete standstill.

We completely neglect the fact that we need water to survive, but then realize that [[Glacialmaw]] will be able to create or purify water after our next long rest.

[[Palu]] is itching to chomp on some dreams as we just sit there for the whole day, not moving anywhere.

[[Draxus]] and [[Kothvush]] both start showing signs of dreaming, muttering in their sleep. [[Palu]] hones in on [[Draxus]]:

>[!summary] Draxus' Dream
>[[Palu]] sees a very gray and cloudy scene. There are sounds of people in agony. As she walks through a cloud of gray, she sees [[Draxus]] holding another [[Drow]] in his lap. It becomes clear that this is his mother. He is crying over her, she looks very frail. After a while, she stops responding to him and he cries. As [[Palu]] walks closer, the image dissipates.

>After a bit, [[Palu]] sees it happen again, and again, and again. After a while, something different happens. She sees [[Draxus]], but sees a [[Demogorgon|two headed dog beast with tails]], swinging his purple axe at the beast.

[[Palu]] breaks down a bit as she processes the dreams. She feels a slight sting just below her armpit, she rubs it and feels a small piece of raised skin, maybe a half inch diameter. The skin is just a little bit faded. After a few minutes, the stinging subsides, in a way.

We wake up and [[Kothvush]] (( Rolls a [[Natural 20]] )) catches the wind in an instant. We feel the wind catch in the sails. [[Palu]] shows her weird discolored skin and [[Kothvush]] takes a peek before touching the skin around it, which feels like normal. He doesn't think he's seen anything like it, but it has the same look and texture of a corpse. [[Kothvush]] takes some notes in his [[Legacy Journal]].

[[Palu]] shatters an [[Ice Knife]] next to [[Glacialmaw]]. He will remember this.

We see a ship off in the distance and estimate it's maybe two thirds the size of [[Lightning McQueen]], about 4 or 5 miles away. [[Draxus]] is itching to commandeer another ship. We see blue fabric flowing in the wind, so [[Kothvush]] moves [[Lightning McQueen]] towards the ship to get a better look. It takes a few hours to get closer, but we eventually see a blue background with a white circle in the center. In the white circle, there's a big tomato shaped thing. We are about 2.5 miles away.

Retcon: [[Kothvush]] used his [[Weaver's Tools]] to create a flag for [[Lightning McQueen]].

[[Glacialmaw]] and [[Kothvush]] insist this is another Lightning McQueen flag. We decide to get even closer - 100 yards behind them. The ship is paaaacked with people. People are fuckin' everywhere. It may appear to be a refugee boat, maybe. They seem concerned that we are approaching. The person steering the ship yells, "Why the fuck are you following us?! If you mean no harm, it's no concern, but keep your distance - we don't want to collide! Our ship left from [[Sorflow]], bringing them to [[Yi]], [[Yidi]]."

We start to turn away and make some more distance between our boats. [[Kothvush]] is relieved of duty by [[Virahck]] so he can get some rest and the ship instantly goes slower. As day turns to night, we see a crowd of ships surrounding a barge (150 feet long). They are unmoving, seemingly empty.

We see a large crowd of people on the deck of the wooden barge, there's also a building on the barge. There's a big picture of a bright red clamshell. People on the deck seem to be having a good time.

[[Virahck]] swings the ship around and pulls up next to some of the boats. We notice another building with another clamshell sign, but this one is pink with a pearl. We meander on over.

There are a wide variety of people of different races, genders, etc. People are wearing bathing suits, drinking, eating food, and stuff. In and out at the red clam, but more in than out at the pink.

[[Draxus]], [[Palu]], and [[Kothvush]] go into the red clam building. It's relatively small with tables and chairs full of people. There's a kitchen and bar and a half giant woman standing at the bar, serving drinks. Maybe about 40 people here. [[Draxus]] asks for context from the barkeep.

She responds, "Oh! I didn't notice you! What you want to know about the [[Red Clam]]? We run one of the only floating bar and brothel's in the world! We circle the globe. We got some oars to push it sometimes, but we kinda just let it go. I'm [[Roth Sag]], nice to meet you. Do you need a room, drink? Rooms are rented by the hour, 10 silver for smaller rooms, 13 for larger. Wide variety of whores too! Can rent a table, if you'd like."

Everyone else leaves the barge, but [[Palu]] stays on the barge and has a grand old time. After a few hours, [[Palu]] sees movement out of the corner of her eye in the water. After a few seconds, she realizes there's a wave in the ocean coming towards the barge, closing in quickly. She braces herself as huge crowds of people get toppled over. As people surface, we hear a roar of laughter as people roll back onto the barge and continue partying.
