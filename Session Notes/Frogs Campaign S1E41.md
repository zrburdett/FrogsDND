### Session Summary
Twenty [[Yi]] guards begin swarming the street heading straight towards the doorway of the [[Prying Pumpkin]]. As [[Palu]] slips past the guards, she sees a dragonborn woman with a sigil on her breastplate, appearing to be some sort of commander of the group. [[Palu]] detects the commander's thoughts and hears, "I hate this festival, there is so much poor behavior. I've had to break up so many fights today already." [[Palu]] then casts thaumaturgy, causing her voice to boom across the crowd while simultaneously casting a spell to create darkness around the door of the building. "The magical [[Glacialmaw]] Trundlemain has cast a spell upon you. You can only find him this way!" she says, attempting to divert the attention of the guards to her as she runs off into the ever gathering crowd.

[[Palu]]'s booming voice causes everybody to turn and look at her before panicking from terror. The heavier armed guards in the group set their sights on [[Palu]], but luckily her distraction is able to help not only [[Virahck]] slip into the crowd, but it also helps buy time for [[Glacialmaw]] and [[Kothvush]], who are stuck inside the [[Prying Pumpkin]].

After closing the door on almost two dozen guards, [[Glacialmaw]] and [[Kothvush]] start searching their surroundings, looking for another way out of the building. They head behind the counter and peek through the doorway, locking eyes with an employee before he screams out for help. [[Kothvush]] charges him and pushes him over the chair he just stood up from so [[Kothvush]] and [[Glacialmaw]] could head out the door to the back alley. [[Glacialmaw]] helps [[Kothvush]] scale the side of the sea wall and then runs off in between some of the houses in the alley.

Meanwhile, [[Draxus]] stares at the flat stone wall that once used to be a door. The cracks in the stone begin to shift and the flat wall begins to show some depth. Before he knows it, a face is beginning to take shape in the wall. "Uhh are you stuck in this wall?" Draxus asks. The stone responds, "Stuck in the stone? No, I'm not stuck in the stone. YOU are stuck in the stone!" As the face speaks, [[Draxus]] begins to recognize it as the man who was in the office on the top floor. The stone continues, telling [[Draxus]] that he is [[Hubert Pumpkinpatch]], the owner of the [[Prying Pumpkin]]. Hubert explains that [[Draxus]] is far too unpredictable and violent and would rather he remain locked in this cell before he can cause any more trouble, however, he will reconsider if [[Draxus]] will entertain an arrangement.

[[Hubert Pumpkinpatch]] lays out his family story - that he is the current executive of the hundred year old establishment of the [[Prying Pumpkin]] and that it has been passed on from generation to generation helping to acquire long lost goods. His family apparently had developed a technique for locating such items. Before having the responsibility of the [[Prying Pumpkin|Pumpkin]] to look after, Hubert traveled the world, gathering experience so that he would be able to successfully lead the business before his father died. He recounts a tale of an unfortunate shipwreck of which he was the sole survivor.

He washed up on the shore of a small place called [[Prison Isle]] and was quickly imprisoned by a group of goblins who inhabited the island. He suffered there for many months, but after a while, a new group of prisoners were brought to the cages. After a short stint in custody, they staged a prison break and were able to release Hubert in the process, but they were not kind to him. One of the group, [[Glacialmaw]], took a piece from Hubert, and Hubert says the price must be paid.

He continues to speak to [[Draxus]], confirming that the child [[Draxus]] was following from before was sent by him - when he heard [[Glacialmaw]] was in [[Yi]], he sent out his child slaves to find him. [[Hubert Pumpkinpatch]] tells [[Draxus]] that he needs to deliver [[Glacialmaw]] to pay the price of his transgressions and needs [[Draxus]] to give some sort of collateral while he searches for [[Glacialmaw]]. [[Draxus]] sticks his hands into Hubert's stone mouth and a stinging pain runs up his arms as Hubert bites down. Draxus takes his arms out of the stone mouth and reveals two stumps where his hands were. The stone face then fades back into the wall and the doorway reemerges, allowing [[Draxus]] to aid three people to exit the cell area before the stone once again closes behind him. They make they way up the stairs and emerge in the alleyway next to the [[Prying Pumpkin]].

Meanwhile, [[Virahck]] continues to run hoping to meet up with [[Palu]], but is unable to catch up. [[Palu]] had been running at full speed trying to get away from the guards who were now chasing her, but unfortunately after tripping over a fruit stand, she finds herself on the docks with nowhere to go and quickly gets tackled before being placed into custody. She essentially admits to aiding in [[Glacialmaw]]'s escape and is then led up into the industrial district and is placed in jail.

[[Glacialmaw]], at this point, is running from the [[Prying Pumpkin]] and makes his way to the Circle before entering the [[Church of Abertai]] for safe harbor, stating that he will be donating 50 gold, so they happily let him in.

[[Draxus]] and [[Kothvush]] separately make their way to the Circle, seeing [[Uncle Glom's Band]] performing on stage as the crowd gathers for the [[Dreaming of Dirigibles]] giveaway. They begin reading off the prizes, but just as they get to the final prize winner, the sunlight appears to dim substantially and light disappears from the ground as a shadow spreads from the center of the Circle. Many look up into the sky to see a massive blood red pyramid with hundreds of bats emerge from the pyramid above. About 30 or so bats land in the Circle and transform into humanoids - upon closer look, they are vampire spawn. The mayor is ushered off stage and the crowd scrambles in a panic as the vampire spawn begin absolutely slaughtering anybody in sight.

In the chaotic scene, [[Draxus]] takes the opportunity to plant a magic bean in the ground before shedding a single tear to water it - all of a sudden, 11 thick and stalky 5-foot-tall mushrooms burst out of the ground and begin shrieking with an ear piercing shrill tone, heard from 300 feet around. [[Draxus]] takes out *another* bean and plants it, causing 9 bright pink toads to dig themselves up out of the ground. [[Draxus]] swings his foot at one of them and as his foot strikes the amphibian, it is launched in the air and begins transforming from this small pink toad into a massive 12-foot-tall snarling red haired ape creature. He continues slamming the remaining toads, effectively summoning a small group of the apes, who indiscriminately thrashing everything in sight.

The City of [[Yi]] is in a state of pure chaos.

### Log
[[Glacialmaw]] and [[Kothvush]] are trapped in the doorway of the [[Prying Pumpkin]] with about 20 guards surrounding the entrance. [[Glacialmaw]] closes the door behind him and the two of them walk further into the [[Prying Pumpkin]].

[[Palu]] sees a dragonborn woman with a sigil on her breastplate, appearing to be some sort of commander of the group. She detects her thoughts, hearing, "I hate this festival, there is so much poor behavior. I've had to break up so many fights today already." [[Palu]] casts thaumaturgy to make a booming voice and casts a spell to create darkness around the door of the business. "The magical [[Glacialmaw]] has cast a spell upon you. You can only find him this way!" then [[Palu]] runs off, attempting to divert their attention to her.

There are a ton of people around because of the commotion and *everybody* turns around and looks at [[Palu]], then book it out of there, causing a panic. The heavier armed guards set their sights on [[Palu]]. [[Virahck]] runs in the opposite direction of Palu. [[Glacialmaw]] and [[Kothvush]] start looking for a back door. There's an employee who yells out, but [[Kothvush]] pushes him over and the two of us run out the back door. [[Glacialmaw]] assists [[Kothvush]] in getting up the sea wall just beside the alley, then Glacialmaw darts behind some buildings to get away.

[[Draxus]] looks around the door that locked him in this area and feels some of the stone start pressing towards him. The lines appear to be making up the shape of a face, becoming more and more prominent. "Uhh are you stuck in this wall?" One if the stone face's eyes open and it states quietly, "Stuck in the stone? No I'm not stuck in the stone. You are stuck in the stone."

"Why did you come to the [[Prying Pumpkin]]?" Upon reflection, it seems like the face might be the same as the guy in the big office at the top of the building. "My name is [[Hubert Pumpkinpatch]], the owner of this establishment. There is no need for me to let you out, we can speak face to face here. You seem unpredictable, violent, and I would rather keep you in the cell. You may be able to do something for me... There have been many strange encounters here at the [[Prying Pumpkin]], all of which involve a halfling interrupting the operations here. I am owed vengeance. I am the executive of the [[Prying Pumpkin]] - it has been a family business for a long time, present in the city for hundreds of years. My descendants have been running it for several years. This business acquires long lost goods and my family has developed a technique for finding such items. Before my father died, I was traveling the world and ensuring I had the proper experience to lead the pumpkin before he passed. I found myself in an unfortunate shipwreck and I was the only survivor. I washed up on shore of a small island, named prison isle, and I was imprisoned by a group of goblins who inhabited the island. I suffered there for several months but after a little while, a group was brought to the prison who staged a prison break. They released me, however, they were quite unkind to me. Before we even escaped, I was attacked and a piece of me was stolen by [[Glacialmaw]]. From what I've been told, you have some affiliation with this character. Prior to the detonation of our breakroom, I learned of your connection to [[Glacialmaw]]. Yes, I sent the child to try and reach [[Glacialmaw]]. The simplest way to explain it is that I can be aware of the location of my stolen artifact. When [[Glacialmaw]] visited to the city, I sent out my child slaves to survey. Needless to say, you and your collective have caused enough disturbances for me to behave as I wish. The price must be paid - for the people in here and for [[Glacialmaw]]'s transgressions. As such, you will be held until the price is paid."

"I'm not asking you to enact revenge, all I'm asking is for you to deliver [[Glacialmaw]] and my finger in order to pay the price. I'm going to need some sort of collateral before I let you go to get [[Glacialmaw]]. I don't want gold. I would like you to put your hands into my mouth." He opens his mouth really wide and [[Draxus]] looks rather uncomfortable. [[Draxus]] takes off his amulet and holds it up, but he doesn't seem very interested. [[Draxus]] gets sick of bargaining and sticks his hands in the mouth. [[Draxus]] feels a horrible flash of pain as the mouth bites down. He pulls his arms out of the mouth, revealing two stumps. The stone then slides out of the way and [[Draxus]] calls out for the prisoners to get away. Three people are able to make it out before the stone closes behind them. There's an older woman, a 13 year old boy, and the person he was talking to earlier. As [[Draxus]] heads out of the trap door, he emerges into the alley rather than back into the altar room.

Meanwhile, [[Virahck]] continues to run, hoping to meet back up with [[Palu]]. The guards were more focused on [[Palu]] so [[Virahck]] doesn't see anybody following him. [[Palu]], however, sees a bunch of guards following closely behind him. He trips over a fruit stand and stumbles on the ground, with the guards almost reaching him. [[Palu]] is able to escape their grasp as he runs down onto the docks, but is quickly tackled by the guards as [[Palu]] gives up. Palu didn't keep his mouth shut and admitted to aiding [[Glacialmaw]]'s escape.

[[Glacialmaw]] dodges and weaves between buildings to try and escape. He makes it up to the Circle near the [[Church of Abertai]]. They mayor is up by the circle speaking to a bunch of fancy robed people. Some sort of magic is being used to amplify voices - they are speaking about the success of [[Dreaming of Dirigibles]] and will be announcing the winner of the dirigible contest, but first a performance from [[Uncle Glom's Band]].

[[Glacialmaw]] walks into the [[Church of Abertai]] stating that he wants to donate 50 gold to the church and they happily let him in.

[[Kothvush]] slides down the sea wall blends into the crowd, making his way to the Circle to hear [[Uncle Glom's Band]].

[[Draxus]] emerges from the trap door and he brings the people he escaped with to the Circle. He recognizes the music as he sees [[Uncle Glom's Band]] on stage.

The guards take [[Palu]] up into the industrial district and is brought into a big building that appears to be a jail. They take all her shit, process her, and toss her into a cell. She notices a building near by that has a big logo on the side with a fish leaping from a wave and it looks familiar. She should be locked up for a bit of time, but not for too long. Just disorderly conduct pretty much so a fine is likely in addition to waiting until [[Glacialmaw]] is captured.

[[Virahck]] wanders around and peers over to the outside of the [[Prying Pumpkin]]. Things seem to be relatively dispersed but there is definitely an increased guard presence than before. He walks up to one of the guards and asks what went on. "There was a violent assault here, some criminal mastermind named [[Glacialmaw]]. Could be in for a sizable reward if he's found. I don't know if they caught anybody but I know you got egg on your shirt!" [[Virahck]] doesn't look down be he attempts to intimidate the guard, furrowing his brow and arching his back, looking like he's in a hockey stance, but he feels a splatter on his shoulder as a bird shits on him. When [[Virahck]] looks down to check for the egg on his shirt, the guard flicks his nose and bursts out laughing. The guards ask him to move along, "Shoo, fly! Shoo!" [[Virahck]] makes his way to the Circle as the band is wrapping up.

The mayor and the [[Dreaming of Dirigibles]] representatives arrive on stage and begin announcing the results. There were about 8,000 tickets. First prize is the dirigible, second is the largest [[Writtle Fruit]] of the day, and third prize is a dirigible tour around the city. [[Glacialmaw]], [[Draxus]], and [[Kothvush]] all had one ticket each. The second prize winner is a little loxodon child, the fruit is larger than their torso. The third prize winner is some dirty peasant. And last but not least, the [[Belligerent Dirigibent]] winner is... but before, the sunlight becomes dimmer... light disappears and some of us look into the sky. The shadow is spreading from the center of the Circle and is grows larger and larger. There's an enormous triangular shape covering the sun. There's a pyramid floating in the sky, blood red in color. We see this flow of small figures flying out of the base of the pyramid and we see the flapping wings of small animals coming out of it. As they get closer, we recognize them as bats as they descend onto the Circle and transform into humanoids - vampire spawn. There are 30 or so that are now on the ground as hundreds fly around the sky. We're all left wondering who won the [[Belligerent Dirigibent]] as the mayor is ushered off stage, shielded by guards.

Just ahead of each of us, we see vampire spawn absolutely slaughtering people left and right. People are scrambling all around, with some making their way into the [[Church of Abertai]], where [[Glacialmaw]] is hiding out.

[[Draxus]] reaches into his pack with his little stump hands and struggles to remove a bean and plant one of the [[Magic Beans]], planting it in the ground before shedding a tear to water the bean. 11 thick stalky 5 foot tall mushrooms burst out of the ground and start shrieking with an ear piercing shrill tone, heard from 300 feet around. [[Draxus]] proceeds to plant another one of the [[Magic Beans]], watering it in the process. 9 bright pink toads crawl out of the ground at his feet. They look like normal toads, other than being bright pink. [[Draxus]] kicks one towards the nearest vampire. As he strikes it, it's form bulges and grows and transforms into a massive 12 foot tall snarling red-haired ape thing (it's donkey kong). [[Draxus]] starts swingin' his axe by summoning it and unsummoning it with his mind, hitting about 4 or 5 toads all over the place. One donkey kong is smashing a vampire, but others are just sweeping the crowd. [[Draxus]] makes his way to the [[Prying Pumpkin]] with his three new friends.

After seeing the bats, [[Virahck]] starts running towards the church. [[Glacialmaw]] doesn't see anybody, so he goes back into the church. [[Kothvush]] thinks he sees familiar faces in the center of the circle and walks towards it. [[Palu]] is sitting in his jail cell, seeing the sun disappear from the sky before a variety of screaming emerges.
