### Session Summary


### Log
_**ANTIQUE SHOP**_ It was robbed about a week prior. It's a small log cabin off the main drag of [[Logor]]. We walk down the main street and see a small wooden cabin - above the door reads [[Ulcer's Curiosities]]. There's a closed sign and the lights are off, but the door is slightly ajar. When you knock, you hear something get dropped and feet are shuffling around. [[Virahck]] opens the door. They tell us they were hired by [[Ulcer]]. There's an embroidered golden symbol on his breastplate. It's in the shape of a bird. They weren't hired by [[Ulcer]], but they don't want any trouble. One of their members robbed this shop earlier this week and took some goods from the place. Something bad happened to her and her sister, and are hoping that there's a clue or a cure here to help them. The person who robbed it is not our priority, but the sister is the leader of our group. The old elf is in the back room and it seems the same affliction is affecting him. [[Virahck]] checks on the elf in the back - his skin is gray, patchy, and flakey, similar to what you've seen before. [[Ulcer]] tells us he purchased items from a dwarf with facial piercings. Many of the things he gave seems quite valuable. There's a receipt in the counter, but there was a beautifully carved jade statue, a jewel encrusted dagger, silver rings, gold crown with onyx, and two glass phials, and a sealed scroll case - a bit over 1,000 gold for all of it. [[Virahck]] sets the vision stone on top of him - he stops breathing a few minutes later. [[Virahck]] panics and tries to cure wounds him. _It does nothing._ [[Virahck]] takes the rock back... [[Draxus]] looks around the room and sees a thinly stocked store, tacky and old items, no surprise this stuff wasn't taken. Not very well taken care of, dirty, etc. [[Draxus]] and [[Palu]] can tell something is up when [[Virahck]] exits the room with a guilty look on his face. [[Palu]] attempts to get past [[Virahck]] to check on Ulcer, but [[Virahck]] blocks him. We somehow convince them to leave, we follow them out.

_**[[Ulcer|ULCER]]'S POCKETS**_Pinkey ring with the sigil of the shop, may have been used as a stamp, 12 gold pieces. [[Palu]] sprinkles the gold over his body and pockets the ring.

_**INN**_ [[Crockpot Cave]] is just an hour up the path. You should be careful - lots of strange folk and wild animals live there. Probably not very safe. We decide to reup on rations at the market. [[Draxus]] starts to sing [[Wonderwall]] for [[Glacialmaw]], inputting his name into the lyrics, too. We are impressed with [[Draxus]]' singing.

_**CAVE**_ We walk for a bit and eventually come across a cave. The cave goes in for 40 feet, then curves. Slim winding tunnel for 30 minutes, the further we walk, the colder it gets. It's rather frigid now. We get to a pool of water, it's flowing. [[Draxus]] attempts to shift the board over the water. [[Draxus]] is approached by some people questioning him. They threaten to kill [[Draxus]] if he doesn't leave. There's a larger pool of water and a couple openings as we get to the larger part of the room.

_**LOOT**_ Only a couple of gold pieces. One has a pouch with 3 dead bats inside. There's also a bucket of bats by the still water.
