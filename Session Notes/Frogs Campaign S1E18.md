### Last time


### Session Summary


### Log
_**COMBAT OVER**_ We head away from the giant's bodies and head straight to [[Ulith Pass]].

**MOUNTAIN ROAD** Steep thin road, little space to stand. We arrive at a vertical wall of rock. [[Ebu Tart|Ebu]] speaks an incantation next to the rock and a door appears and opens before us.

**PALEBANK**
[[Palebank]]
We walk down a winding tunnel, opening up into a wide cave with a dozen buildings. Tiny dots of sparkling lights casting a shallow glow over the cavern. People watch us as we walk into the village. [[Ebu Tart]] brings us to a building in the back of the cave and explains that the village elder lives here.
