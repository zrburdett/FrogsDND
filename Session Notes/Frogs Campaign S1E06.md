### Session Summary


### Log
_**COMBAT**_ We begin attacking it's eyes and head, but seem to struggle hitting it. [[Kothvush]] smacks the fuck out of the creature with his mace but as he swings with his fist, he slips on the slippery deck and falls off the boat into the water. [[Glacialmaw]] attempts to hit the creature as it dives into the water, but he get's his pike stuck into the deck. [[Palu]] sends one more volley of missiles exploding the creatures neck, leaving it bleeding out and sinking towards the bottom of the ocean. _**COMBAT OVER**_

After a grueling battle, we decide to finish our long rest. _**LONG REST**_

[[Mo]] attempts to secretly boof some more powder but it's extremely clear what he's trying to do.

**WATERLOGGED SHIP BELLY** [[Klept]], [[Virahck]], and [[Kothvush]] go down the stairs into the water. [[Kothvush]] only goes as far as he can see but the others begin to explore underneath. Huge hole in the center of the ship, fish swimming around, crates, barrels, corpse. [[Klept]] catches 3 fish while underwater! - then realizes [[Sir Schwaggus]] is feeling very... uncomfortable having to hold it's breath. [[Klept]] returns to the stairs to give [[Sir Schwaggus]] some air time. [[Virahck]] finds 6 copper and a dagger from a waterlogged corpse. [[Palu]] swims down and starts looking in the other rooms in the ship's belly.

**BUCKET ROOM** There's a bucket in this room and the walls are covered in... _sludge?_

**STERN ROOM** The door doesn't budge, seems like something is blocking it. [[Palu]] attempts to blast it open. [[Palu]] shoots some magic missiles at the door, looks through the broken door and sees that it's probably destroyed completely by the rocks.

[[Virahck]] sticks his finger in the sludge and takes a slurp while [[Kothvush]] realizes it's literal shit coming from the shit room on the boat. [[Mo]] and [[Azurak]] have a moment holding hands with poop between them.

[[Virahck]] says something something "send nudes pls" which turns the boat into the small version, large version, and then it closes, dropping all the shit we stored in it. We manage to retrieve everything from it except [[Virahck]]'s old chainmail.

**SMALL WATERLOGGED ROOM** Small storeroom, broom, buckets, mops, cleaning supplies.

**LARGE WATERLOGGED ROOM** Border of benches, meeting area of sorts, barrel filled with sand - grabs one baggie floating in the water.

_**SET SAIL**_ We head off west towards [[Tapu Ero]] area.

_"In [[Yogurv Bay]] on [[Weespuun]], we lived a nudist lifestyle and milked goats and ate goat products all the time. We got some mailmen - mail carriers, they avoid us cause... We'll they're very friendly, but they don't really stay and chat, not about the dinglin' and danglin', don't like seeing what all the hubub is about."_ - [[Mo]]

_**LAND HO!**_ As we get closer, we see a city. Several large ships coming and going from the large docks found at the waterfront. Interior wall with a center city. We sail over to the interior of the bay. We see an area that seems to be for personal use. _"Five gold please, I'll secure your boat for you."_ - [[Dockmaster]] The dockmaster shows a piece of metal that shows the insignia of the city. _"Pls!"_ [[Glacialmaw]] says, and [[Azurak]] collects the box and tosses some coins to the dockmaster.

We read some signs to gather more information. We see a sign for _[[The Dullard Gull]]_ which appears to be a tavern. It seems like we've arrived at **[[Eroll Cove]]**, based on the map rubbing and map from [[Derrick Ifburge]].

We keep moving and see some buildings. _[[The Supple Wench]]_, a brothel _[[The Twisted Inn]]_, pretty fucked up building, but still clearly operating

**THE TWISTED INN**
[[The Twisted Inn]]
_"Oh my god, what is a troll doing in here?! You speak common?? How did you learn to speak common? You're not here to kill us all? What, are you the captain of a ship? The satyr is the captain of the ship??"_ - Lady at the Inn The common spaces are completely full but we have some other options. We only serve breakfast, _[[The Dullard Gull]]_ is popular or _[[The Lucky Knife]]_, too. [[Mo]] pours some powder on the table in an attempt to bribe the woman to feed us. [[Klept]] wipes away the powder and begins heading towards _[[The Dullard Gull]]_. The rest of us apologize and [[Virahck]] attempts to convince the woman that the powder is just sand - she believes it. She tells us [[Eroll Cove]] is a medium size port city, helping to move goods to **[[Tapu Ero]]**. There are gates on the east and west sides of the city. On the western side, there is a small village called **[[Erop]]**, that wraps around the western wall. You need to be careful about coming in, especially the upper city. They will generally check your belongings - the wealthy and noble class lives there. There is a bustling market called _[[The Wedge]]_ down here though. There might be a sailing school here too? There isn't much beyond the eastern gates besides access to the upper city. Two gold per night for a room, breakfast included.

_**[[The Dullard Gull|THE DULLARD GULL]]**_ Bustling place, fried fish smell. We all sit down at a table in the back. There's a man sitting at the desk, but he doesn't have any legs. Our rooms are full, but we could accommodate you with a hammock in the common room - 5 copper each. Today we are featuring blackened halibut and local ale - 1 silver for one of each. The man is also missing 4 fingers on one hand. _"I should've died in battle as a sellsword, but I didn't and I've been living here ever since."_ - [[Dick Crabbe]] We give him a gold and 5 copper to cover our stay in the common room and our dinner.

**COMMON ROOM** We head back to the common room and sleep through the night. [[Glacialmaw]] wakes up and sees someone grabbing the _**[[Toe Jar]]**_, but [[Glacialmaw]] speaks to them in giant, but they run away, leaving the jar. [[Virahck]] notices that someone has pried off several emeralds from his chainmail armor - the biggest gem on the belt is still there, but it's all scratched up. _**LONG REST**_
