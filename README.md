*"**Obsidian** is a powerful and extensible knowledge base that works on top of your local folder of plain text files."*

In order to make the most of the notes as they've been written, you will want to download the Obsidian app, linked above, which will allow you to maintain your own locally hosted set of notes which stretch all the way back to Session 2 of this campaign.

## Initial Setup

To get started, first download both the Obsidian app and these notes by pressing the code dropdown in the top right, and downloading this repository whichever way you would like.

Once downloaded, open the Obsidian app and select the option to *Open folder as vault*, selecting the folder you've just downloaded.

At this point, the Obsidian Vault will open and you can now navigate through the notes using the file explorer on the lefthand side or using the links contained in each note. The note of *Dal Glug's Awakening* contains links to all session notes and important information that's already been filled in. Links within notes that are slightly dimmer than others are for files that have not yet been created, but clicking on the brighter links will open the file associated with that link.

When looking at a particular note in Obsidian, you can also see every instance in which the note is mentioned, also known as backlinks. These can be seen by opening the right side panel and clicking the button for backlinks.

You'll also see the way that links are created in Obsidian is with double brackets like so: `[[ ]]`. Anything within the double brackets will link to a note, whether that note has been created or not. Clicking on one of the diummer links that does not have a note that's already created will create that file for you, otherwise, the link will take you to the pre-existing note, where you can view everything that's been written already for that topic.
